		<p><span>AT&amp;T will no longer charge a flat fee for customers who terminate their service contracts early, opting instead to charge based on the time left on an individual's contract. The telecom provider also has dropped the rule requiring customers to extend their contracts if they alter their level of service. </span></p>
