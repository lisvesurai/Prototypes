		<p><span>Motorola recorded its first profit in three quarters, although sales continued to decline. The company shipped 900,000 Razr 2 handsets during the quarter, which helped slim the loss in the mobile-phone unit to $138 million. Motorola expects fourth-quarter earnings to come in between 12 and 14 cents a share, which would beat analysts' expectations. "We indeed believe the worst is over," Jim Suva, a Citigroup analyst, wrote in a research note.</span></p>
