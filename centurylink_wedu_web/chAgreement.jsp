							<p><b>4. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration;  Governing Law. </b>PLEASE  READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS RIGHTS THAT YOU MAY OTHERWISE HAVE. IT  PROVIDES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH MANDATORY ARBITRATION WITH A FAIR  HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY OR  THROUGH A CLASS ACTION. <b></b></p>
							<p>(a) <u>Arbitration  Terms</u>. You agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to  the equipment or this agreement (whether based in contract, tort, statute,  fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding  arbitration. The sole exceptions to arbitration are that either party may  pursue claims: (1) in small claims court that are within the scope of its  jurisdiction, provided the matter remains in such court and advances only  individual (non-class, non-representative, non-consolidated) claims; and (2) in  court if they relate solely to the collection of any debts you owe to Qwest. </p>
							<p style="margin:0 0 10px 25px;">(i) <i>Arbitration Procedures.</i> Before commencing  arbitration you must first present any claim or dispute to Qwest in writing to  allow Qwest the opportunity to resolve the dispute. If the claim or dispute is  not resolved within 60 days, you may request arbitration. The arbitration will  be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). The Federal  Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16, not state law, will govern the  arbitration of the dispute. Colorado state law, without regard to choice of law  principles, will otherwise govern and apply to any and all claims or disputes.  All face-to-face proceedings will be conducted at a location which is  reasonably convenient to both you and Qwest.&nbsp;  Arbitration is final and binding. Any arbitration will be confidential,  and neither you nor Qwest may disclose the existence, content or results of any  arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of  the arbitration award. The arbitrator may award any relief or damages that a  court could award, except an arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or  contrary to what this agreement provides.  Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having  jurisdiction. </p>
							<p style="margin:0 0 10px 25px;">(ii) <i>Costs of Arbitration.</i> The party  requesting arbitration must pay the applicable AAA filing fee, except that if  you are an individual using the Services for household or personal use and you  initiate arbitration against Qwest:&nbsp; (1)  you must pay one-half the arbitrator&rsquo;s fees up to a maximum of $125 if your  claim does not exceed $10,000; (2) you must pay one-half the arbitrator&rsquo;s fees  up to a maximum of $375 if your claim is more than $10,000 but less than  $75,000; and (3) you must pay an Administrative Fee in accordance with the  AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Fee Schedule if your claim exceeds $75,000 or if your claim is  non-monetary. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, each party will pay  its own expenses of the arbitration, including the expense of its own counsel,  witnesses, and presentation of evidence at the arbitration. If any party files  a judicial or administrative action asserting a claim that is subject to  arbitration and another party successfully stays such action or compels  arbitration, the party filing that action must pay the other party&rsquo;s costs and  expenses incurred in seeking such stay or compelling arbitration, including  reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. </p>
							<p>(b) <u>Waiver of Jury and Class Action</u>. By  this agreement, both you and Qwest are waiving rights to litigate claims or  disputes in court (except small claims court as set forth in paragraph (a)  above). Both you and Qwest also waive the right to a jury trial on your  respective claims, and waive any right to pursue any claims on a class or  consolidated basis or in a representative capacity. </p>
							<p><b>5. Miscellaneous. </b></p>
							<p>(a) <u>Privacy</u>.&nbsp; Qwest will not  be liable for any lack of privacy you may experience while using the equipment. </p>
							<p>(b) <u>Entire Agreement</u>.&nbsp; This  agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Qwest. This  agreement supersedes any inconsistent or additional representations or promises  that may have been made by any of Qwest&rsquo;s representatives, agents or  distributors. </p>
							<p>(c) <u>Severability</u>.&nbsp; In the  event that any provision of this agreement is held to be void, voidable, or  unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this agreement will remain in full  force and effect. </p>
							<p>(d) <u>Title</u>.&nbsp; Ownership and all risk of loss of the equipment will transfer to you  upon delivery, except damage caused by Qwest, its agents or  subcontractors.&nbsp;</p>
