			<h1>Why SwipePay</h1>
			
			<p>Several problems are occurring in the prepaid mobile industry, specifically  around billing, reload and operating costs.  These problems not only impact the Mobile Operator, but each member of  the value chain in delivering premium services.&nbsp; SwipePay was created to solve these problems by deploying targeted  solutions that positively impact ARPU and decrease operating costs for each  member within the value chain.</p>
			<p>Key Problems Facing Prepaid Operators and Mobile Publishers:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>40 percent failure rates for service transactions.</li>
				<li>30 percent of the prepaid mobile audience at any given time  carries a $0 balance in their prepaid wireless accounts.</li>
				<li>Data services and premium messaging continues to grow while  publishers and operators are failing to maximize subscriber revenue.</li>
				<li>Reload costs are as high as $7.50 per reload due to existing  processes and commission structures.</li>
				<li>Carriers have failed to capture revenue from P2P transactions  despite their perfect position to service the expanding unbanked/underbanked market</li>
			</ol>
