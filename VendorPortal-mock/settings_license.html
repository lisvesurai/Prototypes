                      2.1	Description of the BlackBerry App World
                      
                      The BlackBerry App World is a RIM proprietary storefront comprised of various Kiosks established to serve as a channel for vendors to have applications and other downloadable content (identified on the Vendor Portal from time to time as the type of products that may be made available through the BlackBerry App World) resold and/or distributed to End Users.  RIM also offers the My World repository to End Users, at no charge, to enable them to reinstall Paid Applications purchased and Free Applications obtained through the BlackBerry App World on their wireless handheld devices in accordance with the My World rules, and requires Vendors to grant to RIM and End Users the rights necessary to facilitate this repository.  RIM also enables End Users to provide feedback on Applications available through the BlackBerry App World, and Vendor acknowledges and agrees that RIM shall have no liability for such End User feedback or the manner in which such End User feedback is used and/or displayed.
                      
                      2.2	Additional Agreements for Paid Applications 
                      
                      RIM does not act as the merchant and/or seller of record for Paid Applications, and if Vendor wishes to make Paid Applications available through the BlackBerry App World then:  (a) these must be made available through an MoR Kiosk; and (b) Vendor will be required to enter into an agreement with one or more MoRs, including the MoR operating that Kiosk.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in any such agreement shall amend, supersede or otherwise affect the provisions of this Agreement.  The payment methods for Vendor in relation to Paid Applications will be determined by the MoR.  As of March 2009, Vendor must have an account in good standing with PayPal Inc. in order to be paid the amounts it is due in relation to the resale or distribution of Paid Applications on MoR Kiosks.
                      
                      2.3	Vendor Registration and Application Submission
                      
                      If Vendor wishes to use the BlackBerry App World as a channel for an Application, Vendor must apply through the Vendor Portal for registration as a BlackBerry App World vendor.  In order to register, Vendor must pay the Administration Service Fee as set forth in the Vendor Portal from time to time, and unless another payment method is expressly authorized by RIM either on the Vendor Portal or otherwise, Vendor must make this payment(s) through their account with PayPal Inc.  RIM shall notify Vendor whether Vendor has been accepted by RIM as a BlackBerry App World vendor, as determined in RIM&rsquo;s sole discretion.  If Vendor&rsquo;s registration is rejected, the Administration Service Fee will be refunded to Vendor by RIM.  If RIM notifies Vendor of RIM&rsquo;s acceptance of Vendor as a BlackBerry App World vendor then:  (a) that notice shall constitute RIM&rsquo;s acceptance of this Agreement, which shall thereupon become a binding agreement between RIM and Vendor; and (b) Vendor may then submit Applications through the Vendor Portal.  Vendor shall submit only the latest production release version of Applications that comply with the BlackBerry App World Guidelines.  Vendor must provide all information about each Application reasonably requested by RIM and any applicable MoRs through the Vendor Portal or otherwise, including without limitation any requested Vendor Content, Vendor&rsquo;s suggested Application category and the hardware, software and system requirements for each Application.  The categorization of an Application shall be in RIM&rsquo;s sole discretion.  RIM may from time to time request additional information and/or Vendor Content, and may require Vendor to supply this additional information and/or Vendor Content for Applications that have already been submitted by Vendor.
                      
                      2.4	Application Evaluation and Acceptance
                      
                      RIM may test, or have tested, and will evaluate Applications for their suitability as applications made available by RIM through the BlackBerry App World, but has no obligation to do so.  RIM may also perform similar testing and evaluation services as a service provider for the MoRs.  Such testing is for RIM&rsquo;s and/or an MoR&rsquo;s internal use only, and shall not be used as a representation by Vendor or any third party as to the performance or quality of an Application.  Nothing in this Agreement shall limit RIM&rsquo;s ability to test and evaluate Applications, in any manner whatsoever, to assess usage of APIs by Applications and whether Applications comply with the BlackBerry App World Guidelines or contain any malware, and RIM reserves the right to test and evaluate each update, upgrade and version of an Application.  Upon receiving notification from RIM that its Application has been accepted, Vendor may initiate the publication of that Application on the applicable Kiosk on the BlackBerry App World at the time it wishes, by indicating its intention to do so on the Vendor Portal.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, RIM will make the Application available to End Users within a commercially reasonable period of time after such initiation by Vendor.
                      
                      2.5	Application Availability
                      
                      Vendor may suspend the availability of an Application at any time by indicating its decision to do so on the Vendor Portal, and RIM shall arrange for the removal of the Application from the BlackBerry App World within a commercially reasonable period of time from RIM&rsquo;s receipt of notification from Vendor (as set out above) of its decision.  However, Vendor acknowledges and agrees that RIM shall not have any obligation to remove a suspended Application from the My World repository of Applications for any End User and that nothing herein will affect an End User&rsquo;s right to continue to use an Application it has rightfully acquired through the BlackBerry App World.  RIM and/or an MoR may, at any time, in their sole discretion and for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation a breach of the BlackBerry App World Guidelines, excessive returns or chargebacks associated with an Application, a payment processor&rsquo;s refusal to provide services in relation to an Application, Vendor&rsquo;s failure to meet the support obligations set out in this Agreement, or a third party claim made in relation to an Application, with or without advance notice to Vendor, cease to make available any Applications through the BlackBerry App World or a specific Kiosk, at all, or in part, including only in specified jurisdictions, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute RIM&rsquo;s or any MoR&rsquo;s commitment to make available, or to continue to make available, Vendor&rsquo;s Applications.  If RIM does not provide Vendor with notice of the removal prior to it taking place, RIM shall do so, by means of the Vendor Portal or otherwise, within a commercially reasonable period following the removal.  Vendor further acknowledges and agrees that RIM reserves the right, but has no obligation, to remove an Application from an End User wireless handheld device and/or disable (in whole or in part) the operation of an Application, and the End User&rsquo;s access to such Application through My World, if the End User&rsquo;s payment for that Application has been refunded by or charged back to the applicable MoR, or if the End User has engaged in fraud, or as provided in the BlackBerry App World Guidelines (including without limitation a breach thereof).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor further acknowledges and agrees that RIM may, at any time, in RIM&rsquo;s sole discretion and for any reason whatsoever, remove an Application from an End User&rsquo;s wireless handheld device and/or remove such Application from the End User&rsquo;s My World repository.
                      
                      3.	Licenses
                      
                      3.1	Application License
                      
                      Vendor hereby grants to RIM a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license to:  (a) use, reproduce, have reproduced, make and have made Applications submitted to the Vendor Portal, for the purposes of evaluating and testing Applications on RIM&rsquo;s own behalf or on behalf of MoRs, and to permit third parties to do so; and (b) use, reproduce, have reproduced, make, have made, import, distribute, sell and offer to sell (i.e. in the case of Free Applications to distribute, market and otherwise promote) through the BlackBerry App World Free Applications to End Users with wireless handhelds activated on Carrier Networks and to End Users with any other RIM proprietary wireless handhelds that are distributed by RIM without the capability of operating on a wireless cellular network; (c) use, reproduce, have reproduced, make, have made, import, offer to sell and distribute Applications for the purposes of providing delivery, fulfillment and/or other services to MoRs that are making Applications available through their MoR Kiosk; and (d) use, reproduce, have reproduced, make, have made, import, and distribute Applications to the extent necessary to enable the My World digital repository (as defined from time to time) for Applications made available through the BlackBerry App World, and to permit third parties to perform the activities listed above on behalf of RIM.  The rights (including the license rights) and obligations under this Agreement shall extend to RIM&rsquo;s affiliates.  RIM shall be liable for any breach of this Agreement by any of its affiliates.
                      
                      3.2	License Key Generation
                      
                      For Paid Applications Vendor shall be required to indicate to RIM through the Vendor Portal whether, and what type of, License Keys are required for an Application, and shall provide the appropriate mechanisms as described in the Vendor Portal to provide RIM the appropriate License Keys.  In order to enable the generation of a Dynamic License Key RIM shall supply to Vendor data, which may include End User Data, which Vendor shall only use for the purpose of generating a Dynamic License Key.  For each Paid Application, Vendor shall generate a License Key for each wireless handheld device on which an End User is authorized to use such Paid Application, including wireless handheld devices on which End Users are authorized to download and install Applications by means of the My World repository.
                      
                      3.3	License Restrictions
                      
                      Vendor acknowledges and agrees that Applications may be downloaded by End Users with wireless handhelds operating on Carrier Networks and that Carrier Networks includes not only the wireless networks selected by the Vendor, but also on the wireless networks operated by the roaming partners of these carriers.  If Vendor does not have the rights necessary to distribute an Application (and any portion thereof) either globally, or at least to End Users with wireless handhelds activated on both the selected and roaming wireless networks, and to permit others to do so, or Vendor is otherwise unable to control the jurisdictions in which End Users may download and/or use that Application, then Vendor must not make, or seek to make, that Application available through the BlackBerry App World. 
                      
                      3.4	Application EULA
                      
                      Vendor shall include the end user license agreement (&ldquo;Application EULA&rdquo;) under which Vendor wishes to license its Applications within such Applications for the particular jurisdictions in which the Application is to be made available.  The Application EULA shall at a minimum include provisions excluding RIM, airtime service providers (which for clarity includes telecommunications carriers), and any MoR making the Application available through its Kiosk, from any liability whatsoever in relation to Applications made available through the BlackBerry App World (not necessarily by name, but at least by role, e.g. channel partners and associated service providers) including without limitation in relation to the sale, distribution or use thereof, or the performance or non-performance of Application, and shall make RIM, airtime service providers, and any such MoR third party beneficiaries to the Application EULA in respect of these provisions.  The Vendor must also provide End Users with at minimum notice of any limitations on the countries and/or Carrier Networks in or on which the Application may be installed and/or used.
                      
                      Vendor acknowledges and agrees that neither RIM nor any MoR is under any obligation to enforce in any manner the provisions of the Application EULA, neither RIM nor any MoR shall be responsible for any breach of the Application EULA or any other agreement between Vendor and an End User.  Any provision of the Application EULA inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement shall not have any force or effect in respect of Applications made available to End Users through the BlackBerry App World.
                      
                      Vendor hereby acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding any terms or conditions in the Application EULA:  (a) RIM and/or MoRs may make it a condition of their agreements with End Users, that an Application made available through the BlackBerry App World, be downloaded, installed and used only on a RIM proprietary handheld software platform operating on a wireless handheld device; and (b) that End Users may reinstall copies of Applications on to their wireless handheld devices from their My World repository in accordance with the then current rules, features and functionality of the My World repository.
                      
                      3.5	Vendor Marks License
                      
                      Vendor hereby grants to RIM a non-exclusive, royalty-free license during the Term to use, reproduce and display the Vendor Marks and Vendor Content for the purposes of:  (a) operating the BlackBerry App World, including without limitation providing delivery, fulfillment and/or other services as fulfillment agent of any applicable MoR; (b) RIM&rsquo;s marketing and promotion of the BlackBerry App World and Applications, including without limitation promotional offers, gift cards and the like; and (c) RIM&rsquo;s distribution, directly and indirectly through third parties, of marketing and promotional materials displaying Vendor Marks and/or Vendor Content.  RIM&rsquo;s uses of the Vendor Marks as set out in subparagraphs (b) and (c) in this Section must be approved by Vendor in writing in advance of each use that is materially different from RIM&rsquo;s use of the Vendor Marks for the purposes of operating the BlackBerry App World, including without limitation providing delivery, fulfilment and/or other services as fulfillment agent of any applicable MoR.  Any such required Vendor consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and such consent shall be deemed given if Vendor does not provide notice to RIM of approval or non-approval within five (5) business days of Vendor&rsquo;s receipt of RIM&rsquo;s written request.  RIM agrees that all of RIM&rsquo;s uses of the Vendor Marks shall inure to the benefit of Vendor.  Without limiting the foregoing, RIM will not:  (i) modify the Vendor Marks, except as expressly approved in writing by Vendor in advance; (ii) combine the Vendor Marks with any other marks or create any composite marks; or (iii) do anything that would compromise Vendor&rsquo;s rights in and to the Vendor Marks.
                      
                      3.6	RIM Marks License
                      
                      RIM hereby grants to Vendor a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license within the regions and countries in which RIM has commercially launched the BlackBerry App World and during the Term to use, reproduce and display the RIM Marks solely in accordance with the BlackBerry App World Branding Guidelines and solely for the purposes of Vendor&rsquo;s marketing and promotion of the BlackBerry App World and Applications for use on a RIM proprietary software platform, including without limitation promotional offers, gift cards and the like.  Vendor&rsquo;s uses of the RIM Marks must be approved by RIM in writing in advance of each use that is materially different from a previously approved use.  Vendor agrees that all of Vendor&rsquo;s uses of the RIM Marks shall inure to the benefit of RIM.  At RIM&rsquo;s request, Vendor shall supply RIM with specimens displaying Vendor&rsquo;s uses and/or intended uses of the RIM Marks.  Without limiting the foregoing, Vendor will not:  (i) modify the RIM Marks, except as expressly approved in writing by RIM in advance; (ii) combine the RIM Marks with any other marks or create any composite marks; or (iii) do anything that would compromise RIM&rsquo;s rights in and to the RIM Marks.

                      4.1	Intellectual Property Rights
                      
                      Vendor does not acquire any right, title or interest in or to any RIM intellectual property.  Other than as expressly set forth herein, RIM does not acquire any right, title or interest in or to any Vendor intellectual property.
                      
                      4.2	Feedback
                      
                      RIM wishes to ensure the BlackBerry App World is a premier channel for vendors.  In order to enable RIM to do so Vendor hereby grants to RIM (with respect to any Vendor Content that identifies any ideas, suggestions, changes, concepts, comments and other feedback relating to the Vendor Portal, BlackBerry App World and related products, processes and programs (collectively &ldquo;Feedback&rdquo;)) a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-licensable and non-revocable license to develop, make, have made, reproduce, have reproduced, import, modify, make derivative works of, sell, and offer to sell Feedback as part of RIM&rsquo;s technology, products or services.  Vendor shall not knowingly provide RIM with any Feedback that is subject to third party intellectual property rights or that includes or reveals any confidential information of Vendor or of any third party.
                      
                      4.3	No Reverse Engineering
                      
                      Except to the extent that this prohibition is precluded by law, RIM may not modify any Application without the Vendor&rsquo;s express written permission, and may not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any Application.
                      
                      4.4	Independent Development
                      
                      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Vendor acknowledges and agrees that RIM is also a software developer and licensee of applications that operate on RIM proprietary software platforms, and that RIM may currently or in the future develop, use, market, promote, distribute and/or license products and/or services that are similar to and/or competitive with any Applications, and that no provision of this Agreement prohibits RIM from doing so.
                      
                      5.	Application Revenue Fee
                      
                      5.1	Application Revenue Fee
                      
                      Vendor shall pay to RIM thirty percent (30%) of Application Revenue (which as defined in this Agreement excludes any fees paid by an End User to an MoR to obtain a copy of an Application through an MoR Kiosk) (&ldquo;Application Revenue Fee&rdquo;) on a calendar quarterly basis in arrears, payable within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter.  Vendor shall provide to RIM a monthly report outlining calculation of the Application Revenue Fee for the applicable month in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  Vendor shall pay the Application Revenue Fee in United States dollars by electronic funds transfer as directed by RIM to Vendor in writing.
                      
                      5.2	Audit
                      
                      During the Term of this Agreement Vendor agrees to keep records, in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, relating to the calculation of the Application Revenue Fee.  To verify such calculations RIM may, during the Term and no more than one (1) time per calendar year, at its sole cost and expense, request such records and Vendor shall provide such records to RIM.  If any such audit demonstrates that Vendor has underpaid the Application Revenue Fee by at least five percent (5%) and at least two-thousand and five-hundred dollars ($2,500) in a given quarter, Vendor shall immediately pay to RIM the reasonable costs of such audit (but not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000)) and the amount of such underpayment, and RIM shall be entitled to perform such audit two (2) times per calendar year.  Further, RIM may appoint a third party, selected at RIM&rsquo;s sole discretion, to perform such audit.
                      
                      5.3	Taxes
                      
                      Vendor shall be responsible for and shall pay all Taxes due under or in relation to this Agreement.  All amounts payable by Vendor to RIM under or in relation to this Agreement are exclusive of any Taxes that may be assessed by any jurisdiction or governmental authority, whether based on gross revenue, the delivery, possession, use or commercial distribution of Applications or any service, or otherwise.  If Vendor is required to withhold any Taxes from payments owing to RIM under this Agreement:  (a) the amount of the payment due will be automatically increased to totally offset such Taxes, so that the amount actually remitted to RIM, net of all Taxes required to be withheld, equals the amounts invoiced or otherwise due; and (b) Vendor shall notify RIM within thirty (30) days in the event such payments have been assessed and/or paid.  Vendor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless RIM from and against any liability (either directly or by way of deduction, withholding or otherwise) for any present or future taxes.
                      
                      6.	Reporting

Vendors will provide all reasonable support to RIM to allow RIM to provide this support, including notification of any Application issues which may result in the failure of a download or any changes to compatibility requirements.  Vendor must provide RIM and End Users, by means of the Vendor Portal or otherwise, with a support contact email address and may also provide a support URL, to enable End Users to obtain support for Applications.  Vendors must provide RIM with at least thirty (30) days&rsquo; notice of any change to the Vendor&rsquo;s support contact information.  RIM may provide Vendor support contact information directly to End Users and/or service providers and may publish this information within the BlackBerry App World, and through RIM training and support tools including self service web forums.
                      
                      Vendor acknowledges and agrees that for Paid Applications the applicable MoR is responsible for and shall have sole discretion in setting and applying the returns policy for Paid Applications made available through that MoR&rsquo;s Kiosk.
                      
                      Except to the extent RIM or any merchants of record expressly assume fulfillment obligations for any Application or any associated products, services, or content, You agree to provide to each end user all copies of Applications and all associated products, services, and content and other things necessary for the end user to obtain the full benefit for which the end user has paid or to which the end user is otherwise entitled (including, for example, where the Application itself is designed to access external services, such as ongoing subscription services which require the delivery or ongoing delivery of additional services, products or content, You agree to provide such additional services, products or content).

                      8.1	Consent to Collection of Information
                      
                      By Vendor submitting personal information relating to Vendor and/or its employees and/or independent contractors (which may or may not, depending on applicable law, include, without limitation, a name, address, email address, authorized payment method account details, verification of identification as specified by RIM, and/or telephone number), to RIM, its affiliates, agents and/or independent contractors, and/or any applicable MoRs, Vendor consents to the collection, use, processing, transmission, and/or disclosure of such information by RIM, its affiliates, agents and/or independent contractors, and/or any applicable MoRs, and Vendor represents, warrants and covenants to RIM that it has obtained all consents necessary under applicable law from individuals to disclose their personal information to RIM, its affiliates, agents and/or independent contractors, and/or any applicable MoRs and for RIM, its affiliates, agents and/or independent contractors, and/or any applicable MoRs, to collect, use, process, transmit, and/or disclose such personal information, for:  (a) the internal use of RIM and its affiliates, including, without limitation:  (i) understanding and meeting Vendor&rsquo;s needs and preferences; and (ii) managing and developing RIM&rsquo;s business and operations; (b) any purpose related to the provision and/or Vendor&rsquo;s use of the BlackBerry App World, Vendor Portal and/or related processes, programs, products and/or services; (c) any purposes permitted or required by any applicable law; and/or (d) any of the other purposes which are set out in RIM&rsquo;s then current privacy policy, which may be viewed at http://www.blackberry.com/legal/privacy.shtml.

                      8.2	Privacy and Data Protection
                      
                      To the extent RIM, its affiliates, agents and/or independent contractors, and/or any applicable MoR, provide Vendor with any End User Data or personal information, Vendor shall only use such End User Data or personal information in accordance with the purpose for which it was provided to Vendor under this Agreement, including without limitation to enable Dynamic License Key generation.

If Vendor provides End User Data to RIM, its affiliates, agents and/or independent contractors, and/or any applicable MoR, Vendor represents and warrants that Vendor will have obtained any necessary consent from the End User to disclose the End User Data to RIM, its affiliates, agents and/or independent contractors, and/or any applicable MoR.  Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict Vendor from using for Vendor&rsquo;s lawful business purposes (in compliance with Vendor&rsquo;s privacy policy, which privacy policy shall be consistent with the privacy obligations set forth in the BlackBerry App World Guidelines) any data provided to Vendor directly by an End User in connection with that End User&rsquo;s registration or use of an Application, provided that in all events Vendor complies with all applicable privacy legislation and Vendor&rsquo;s privacy policy, which privacy policy shall be consistent with the privacy obligations set forth in the BlackBerry App World Guidelines.

                      Except for Application Revenue information there is no need for Vendor to provide to RIM any confidential information under this Agreement, and accordingly Vendor acknowledges and agrees that except as expressly set out in this Section 9, despite any confidentiality agreements between Vendor and RIM, RIM has no confidentiality obligations with respect to any information provided by Vendor to RIM under or in relation to this Agreement or the BlackBerry App World.

                      11.	Warranty Exclusions
                      
                      RIM IS PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE BLACKBERRY APP WORLD, THE VENDOR PORTAL AND ASSOCIATED PROGRAMS, PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RIM MARKS ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; BASIS.  RIM MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS, ENDORSEMENTS, GUARANTEES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, RESULTS, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, DURABILITY, TITLE, NON INFRINGEMENT OR ARISING BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE IN LAW OR FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF THE TRADE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE BLACKBERRY APP WORLD, THE VENDOR PORTAL OR ANY ASSOCIATED PROGRAMS, PROCESSES, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR THEIR PERFORMANCE OR THEIR FAILURE TO PERFORM.
                      
                      12.	Indemnification
                      
                      Vendor shall indemnify, hold harmless, and if requested by RIM defend, RIM, airtime service providers, RIM&rsquo;s affiliates, agents, successors and assigns and their respective directors, officers, employees and independent contractors (each a &ldquo;RIM Indemnified Party&rdquo;) from any costs, damages, losses, settlement fees, and expenses (including without limitation attorney fees and disbursements) incurred directly or indirectly by a RIM Indemnified Party as a result of Vendor&rsquo;s breach of this Agreement and/or as a result of any third party claim, suit, proceeding, judgment, settlement, or cause of action:  (a) alleging the infringement, violation or misappropriation of any intellectual property right, including a patent, design, industrial design, copyright, trade secret or trademark or other proprietary right, by any Applications, Vendor Marks or Vendor Content or the use or distribution thereof, or the combination of any Applications with any other hardware, software, system, or service; (b) alleging libel, slander, or defamation related to any Applications or the use or distribution thereof; (c) alleging any injury, death or property or other damage arising from or related to the performance or non-performance of any Applications or the use or distribution thereof; (d) based on any representations or misrepresentations made by Vendor, including without limitation representations or misrepresentations made by Vendor relating to any Applications; or (e) otherwise related to or arising from any Applications or the use or distribution thereof.  In the event of becoming aware of any such claim a Party shall:  (i) notify the other Party promptly of such claim; (ii) provide to the other Party all information and assistance reasonably requested in relation to such claim, at Vendor&rsquo;s expense; and, (iii) not admit any liability or agree to any settlements by or on behalf of the other Party with respect to such claims without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  If RIM has requested Vendor to defend a claim, and RIM, at any time, has a reasonable basis to believe that Vendor cannot or may not be able to fulfill Vendor&rsquo;s obligations under this Section 12, then, without limiting Vendor&rsquo;s obligations under this Section 12, RIM shall be entitled to provide notice to Vendor that it has decided to become the defending Party, and thereafter to assume control of the defense and/or settlement of any such claim.  If a RIM Indemnified Party is required to indemnify any third party (including without limitation, an MoR or airtime service provider) in respect of a claim made against that third party in relation to any of Vendor&rsquo;s Applications, any claim covered by that indemnity shall be deemed to be a third party claim made against RIM and covered by this provision.  Once RIM notifies Vendor that it will be seeking an indemnity, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, all communications (including the notice) will be deemed confidential information of RIM, which may not be disclosed by Vendor to any third party, other than Vendor&rsquo;s legal advisors, without the prior express written permission of RIM, and in addition, all communications in respect of any such claim shall be subject to common interest privilege.  If a claim hereunder brought against an airtime service provider is also a claim with respect to which RIM or any RIM affiliate is required to indemnify such airtime service provider, then RIM shall, in its sole discretion elect to have such claim treated as a claim against RIM or against the airtime service provider or both under this provision, and shall notify Vendor of same.
                      
                      13.	Exclusion of Liability
                      
                      IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY AIRTIME SERVICE PROVIDER, OR EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO RIM&rsquo;S BREACH OF SECTION 4.3 OR SECTION 9, RIM, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE BLACKBERRY APP WORLD, THE VENDOR PORTAL OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DAMAGES INCURRED BY VENDOR AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPING OR LICENSING APPLICATIONS, VENDOR&rsquo;S USE OF THE VENDOR PORTAL OR BLACKBERRY APP WORLD, THE REJECTION, REMOVAL OR UNAVAILABILITY OF AN APPLICATION OR IF RIM DISCONTINUES THE BLACKBERRY APP WORLD), WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES COULD REASONABLY BE FORESEEN OR THEIR LIKELIHOOD HAS BEEN DISCLOSED TO RIM OR AN AIRTIME SERVICE PROVIDER.  IN NO EVENT SHALL RIM HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENTS DUE TO VENDOR BY AN MOR.    Airtime service providers shall be third party beneficiaries solely for the purposes of this Section 13 and Sections 3.4, 10(l), 10(n), 10(o), 10(r), 12, and 14-16.
                      
                      14.	Limitation of Liability
                      
                      IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY AIRTIME SERVICE PROVIDER, OR EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO RIM&rsquo;S BREACH OF SECTION 4.3 OR SECTION 9, RIM, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE BLACKBERRY APP WORLD OR THE VENDOR PORTAL, THE SUM OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($250.00).
                      
                      15.	Application
                      
                      The limitations, exclusions and disclaimers set out in this Agreement shall apply:  (a) whether an action, claim or demand arises from a breach of warranty or condition, breach of contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or any other kind of civil or statutory liability connected with or arising out of this Agreement; and (b) to RIM and its affiliates and to airtime service providers as well as RIM&rsquo;s and such affiliate&rsquo;s directors, officers, employees, and independent contractors.
                      IN NO EVENT WILL RIM&rsquo;S OR ITS AFFILIATES&rsquo; OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES HAVE ANY PERSONAL LIABILITY UNDER OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL RIM&rsquo;S SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR THE MORS, HAVE ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.  FURTHER, THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL APPLY TO RIM&rsquo;S AFFILIATES.  THE PERSONS MENTIONED IN THIS PROVISION SHALL BE THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS AGREEMENT SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF OBTAINING THE BENEFIT OF THIS PROVISION.
                      
                      16.	Exceptions
                      
                      SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES AND/OR WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS.  THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT APPLY IF AND ONLY IF AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAWS OF A COMPETENT JURISDICTION REQUIRE LIABILITIES BEYOND AND DESPITE THESE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
                      
                      17.	Termination

In addition, RIM may terminate this Agreement immediately:  (a) if Vendor, or if Vendor has licensed the distribution rights for the Applications, the licensor(s) for those Applications, entered into an SDK Agreement with RIM or Plazmic to develop the Application, as applicable, that is no longer in good standing; (b) if RIM is prevented by law or regulation from operating the BlackBerry App World and/or the Vendor Portal or any component thereof or in RIM&rsquo;s opinion RIM is or may become subject to liability as a result of operating BlackBerry App World, the Vendor Portal, using Vendor Marks or Vendor Content, or this Agreement being in place; or (c) with respect to any Paid Applications Vendor makes available through the BlackBerry App World, if for any reason and at any time, RIM does not have an agreement in place with an MoR to provide this channel.

                      17.3	Effect of Termination

                      17.4	Survival
                      
                      The terms, conditions and warranties contained in this Agreement that by their sense and context are intended to survive the performance hereof shall so survive the completion of performance or termination of this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the provisions of Sections 1, 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 4, 5, 8, 10-16, 17.3, 18 and this Section 17.4 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
                      
                      18.	General

                      As this Agreement has no specified term, RIM reserves the right to make changes to the provisions of this Agreement from time to time.  In the event of any such revisions that are material in nature, RIM will provide Vendor with written notice to the most recent address or email address provided by Vendor to RIM by means of the Vendor Portal, and RIM may provide notice of other revisions by posting the revised version of the Agreement on the Vendor Portal.

                      This Agreement may not be assigned by Vendor without RIM&rsquo;s express prior written authorization, and any such assignment without RIM&rsquo;s express prior written authorization shall be null and void and of no effect.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their successors and assigns.  RIM may, without notice to Vendor, assign this Agreement.  Further, RIM may perform all obligations, if any, to be performed by RIM under this Agreement directly or may have some or all obligations performed by its affiliates, agents and/or independent contractors.
                      
                      18.3	Entire Agreement
                      
                      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and cancels and supersedes any prior discussions, correspondence, understandings, agreements, or communication of any nature relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

                      18.4	Governing Law
                      
                      This Agreement is governed by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, excluding any body of law governing conflicts of law.

                      18.5	Notice
                      
                      If RIM wishes to deliver notice to You, except as expressly set out in this Agreement, it must do so in writing by using any of the addresses (postal or email) You provide through the Vendor Portal, and must deliver the notice by courier or email to Vendor.  Notice shall be effective and deemed delivered upon receipt provided that if any such notice fails to reach Vendor because the information provided on the Vendor Portal is not accurate or up to date, notice shall be deemed sufficiently delivered on the date it was sent.  If You wish to give RIM notice of any kind, You must do so in writing and deliver it by courier which provides a written proof of delivery to RIM, addressed to RIM&rsquo;s legal department at 295 Phillip Street, Waterloo, Ontario, N2L 3W8, and notice shall be effective upon RIM&rsquo;s receipt of same.
                      
                      18.6	Relationship
                      
                      This Agreement does not create any agency or partnership relationship between the Parties.
                      
                      18.7	Severability
                      
                      If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any provision in this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall have no effect on the remainder of the Agreement which shall remain in full force.
                      
                      18.8	Waiver
                      
                      Neither Party is to be deemed to have waived or forfeited any right under this Agreement, whether on the basis of failure, delay or any other legal or equitable doctrine, unless such waiver is made in writing signed by an authorized signatory of the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced.  Waiver of any provision, or any breach of any provision, of this Agreement in one instance shall not constitute a waiver as to any other instance.
                      
                      18.9	Export
                      
                      Vendor agrees to provide to RIM through the Vendor Portal and other means, including but not limited to email, all requested export information applicable to any Application.  The BlackBerry App World is designed only to accept Applications that meet, among others, the following criteria:  (1) generally available to the public by being sold, without restriction, from stock at retail selling points by electronic transactions; (2) designed for installation by the End User without further substantial support by the Vendor; and if applicable (3) the cryptographic functionality cannot be easily changed by the End User.  Vendor agrees not to submit Applications that do not meet the above criteria.  Applications with incomplete or inaccurate export information will not be made available through the BlackBerry App World.  Regardless of terminology in applicable laws, rules and regulations specifying the party responsible for obtaining any government related export, import, use, supply and/or transfer permits (&ldquo;Export Permits&rdquo;) required for any Application, Vendor is solely responsible for obtaining and shall obtain all such Export Permits prior to submitting any such Applications through the Vendor Portal.  Vendor shall make any Export Permit available to an MoR, RIM and/or its service providers upon request.  In no event shall MoR, RIM and/or its service providers obtain or be required to obtain any Export Permit needed to receive or enable the download of any Application.  Vendor agrees not to submit Applications which require a US government review prior to availability without also submitting at the same time a valid Commodity Classification Tracking System (CCATS) number.  Vendor acknowledges and agrees that government regulations and laws may further restrict the availability of Applications regardless of the Carrier Networks and/or countries indicated by Vendor in the Vendor Portal, and that RIM is in no way required to make any Application available contrary to RIM&rsquo;s interpretation of these regulations and laws.
                      
                      18.10	Remedies
                      
                      No remedy herein conferred upon RIM is intended to be, nor shall it be construed to be, exclusive of any other remedy provided herein or available at law or in equity, but all such remedies shall be cumulative.

                        (1)  Your Application (and any related Services) must meet the minimum requirements set out in the BlackBerry App World Guidelines, as amended from time to time, which may include by way of example and not limitation requirements and restrictions on compatibility with RIM BlackBerry&reg; wireless handheld devices and software, performance requirements, operational requirements, and content or use requirements (the &ldquo;BlackBerry App World Guidelines&rdquo;).

                        (2)  The information You provide to DR through the Vendor Portal in connection with You and Your Applications (and any related Services) shall be accurate and truthful, and You shall immediately update such information through the Vendor Portal in the event any such information changes.
                        
                        (3)  End Users must place orders themselves through the DR Commerce Solution.  You are not permitted to place orders on behalf of End Users, nor to authorize anyone to place orders on an End User&rsquo;s behalf. 
                        
                        (4)  You will provide DR with all necessary product information through the Vendor Portal so that End Users do not need to contact You for additional information prior to a sale by DR of a copy of an Application. 
                        
                        (5)  You shall provide a Suggested Retail Price through the Vendor Portal for copies of each of the Applications which You wish to make available through the DR Commerce Solution.

                        (6)  You will not submit through the Vendor Portal any products other than Applications (such as but not limited to products which are fulfilled physically), unless otherwise agreed to in writing by You and DR.
                        
                        If DR determines at any time that You or any of Your Applications do not meet or follow any or all of the provisions of this Agreement, or that You are otherwise in breach of any provision of this Agreement, DR may immediately suspend selling copies of Your Applications until such noncompliance and/or breach is remedied, and/or terminate this Agreement for uncured breach in accordance with the terms of Section 7(A) of this Agreement.
                        
                        3.	GENERAL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT
                        
                        A.  Submitting Applications; Approval Process.  You will submit to DR, through the Vendor Portal, each Application You would like DR to make available through the DR Commerce Solution, together with such information as is requested by DR or on DR&rsquo;s behalf by RIM (which in the case of a Service Use Entitlement includes information on the corresponding Service), by means of the Vendor Portal or otherwise, in connection with such Application (including by way of example and not limitation, the Authorized Network(s), the name of the Application, a description of the Application, compatibility and resource requirements for the Application, a copy of the executable Application for testing, and the Suggested Retail Price of the Application).  Your submission of an Application through the Vendor Portal constitutes Your request for DR to sell copies of such Application through the DR Commerce Solution.  DR and RIM shall have the right to review and test such Application (and associated Service where applicable) to ensure conformance with the Blackberry App World Guidelines before offering Your Application for sale through the DR Commerce Solution, but shall have no obligation to do so.  You understand and acknowledge that in order for Your Applications to be made available for sale through the DR Commerce Solution through the Blackberry App World, in addition to this Agreement You must enter into an agreement with DR&rsquo;s service provider RIM for, among other purposes, the purposes of evaluating and testing Your Applications.  The provision of notice to You that Your Application has been approved for resale through the DR Commerce Solution shall constitute approval of Your request for DR to sell copies of such Applications. DR and/or RIM, on DR&rsquo;s behalf, shall notify you if a submitted Application does not meet the BlackBerry App World Guidelines, or if DR has elected not to make available any of Your Applications through the DR Commerce Solution or to not make them available in specific jurisdictions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, You acknowledge that DR may, in DR&rsquo;s sole discretion with or without advance notice, decline to sell any one or more of Your Applications, at any time, at all, or in specific jurisdictions, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute DR&rsquo;s commitment to sell copies of Your Applications.
                        
                        You acknowledge and agree that DR may sell applications, service entitlements and/or other downloadable content provided by others that may be similar to or competitive with Your Applications and associated Services, and that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting You any exclusivity within the Blackberry App World with respect to any of Your Applications, Services associated with Service Use Entitlements, and/or other downloadable content resold by DR. 
                        
                        B.  Non-US Transactions.  With respect to the sale of Applications through Transactions with End Users located in certain countries outside of the United States as determined by DR-Inc (the &ldquo;Non-US Transactions&rdquo;), DR-Ireland  and not DR-Inc will be the seller and merchant of record of such copies of Applications and will be a party to this Agreement solely with respect to its performance of Non-US Transactions, and any references to &ldquo;DR&rdquo; in this Agreement in connection with Non-US Transactions shall be construed as references to DR-Ireland and not DR-Inc. DR-Inc may, upon notice to You, utilize any other corporate affiliate of DR-Inc for the sales of copies of Your Applications to End Users located outside of the United States in certain countries as determined by DR-Inc.
                        
                        C.  Legal Relationship; Sales of Copies of Your Applications.  As an owner, licensor and/or distributor of Applications, You will provide to DR, through the Vendor Portal, a master copy of Your Application to be made available to End Users through the Commerce Solution.  You hereby grant:  (a) to DR and RIM, the right to make copies of Your Applications for its own internal use and testing purposes, for the purposes of evaluating and ensuring Your Applications comply with the BlackBerry App World Guidelines, and for the purposes of RIM&rsquo;s provision of fulfillment and ancillary services as DR&rsquo;s fulfillment agent; and (b) to DR, the right (which right with respect to fulfillment may be sublicensed by DR to RIM or to another third party fulfillment service provider, at DR&rsquo;s option)  to make a copy of that Application when an order for an Application is placed through the DR Commerce Solution by an End User, which copy DR shall purchase from You and resell to that End User along with the right to use the Application or the right to use a Subscription-Based Application or Service corresponding to a Service Use Entitlement (which right to use is subject to the terms and conditions set out in Your EULA), and DR shall purchase such copy from You for the DR Purchase Price on the terms set forth in this Agreement.  You grant to DR a worldwide right to use the materials and information You provide in connection with each such Application to facilitate DR&rsquo;s sale of copies of each such Application through the DR Commerce Solution and the provision of related services by RIM.  You further agree to comply with the terms of all agreements entered into between You and RIM.  DR and/or RIM shall have full control over the design, operation, features and functionality (including available End User payment methods), and End User terms and policies applicable to the Blackberry App World and DR Commerce Solution.  Title to a copy of an Application sold through the DR Commerce Solution to an End User shall pass from DR to that End User upon the completion of both:  (a) DR&rsquo;s receipt of payment for that Application; (b) the provision to the End User of access to download the Application. You will not offer Service Use Entitlements to DR for DR&rsquo;s resale to any country or jurisdiction where access to the corresponding Service or Subscription-Based Application is prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation.
                        
                        D.  Your EULA.   You shall include the EULA under which You wish to license Your Applications within Your Application for the particular jurisdictions in which the Application is to be made available.  This EULA shall at minimum, (i) include provisions excluding DR and RIM (not necessarily by name, but at least by role, e.g. channel partners and associated service providers) from any liability whatsoever in relation to Your Application, including without limitation in relation to the sale or use of copies thereof, or the performance or non-performance of Your Applications, (ii) shall make DR and RIM third party beneficiaries to the EULA with respect to these provision(s), and (iii) shall include an email address (and may include a phone number) through which End Users can obtain support from You as required by Section 3(F) below.  Further, the EULA shall also indicate any jurisdictions in which End Users may not use an Application, and shall identify any export restrictions.  DR shall not remove, or have removed, any EULA from any Application or copy thereof, and shall state in its terms of sale to the End User, that their right to use the copy of the Application sold to them is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the EULA in Your Application.  You agree and acknowledge that any EULA You enter into with an End User is an agreement between You and the End User, and DR shall not be a party to that EULA unless DR is in the role of an End User of Your Application.  Notwithstanding any provision in Your EULA, You acknowledge and agree that DR may make it a term of sale to an End User who obtains a copy of Your Application through the DR Commerce Solution that the Application be downloaded, installed and/or used only on a RIM proprietary handheld software platform on a wireless handheld device.  You shall not include any provision in Your EULA that imposes any obligations on DR or its service providers .
                        
                        E.  End User Data.  Because DR is the reseller to End Users of copies of Your Applications, DR is the party with whom the End User is transacting business for each Transaction.  As such, the End User is giving his/her/its End User Data to DR.  You agree that End User Data obtained in connection with a Transaction shall not be owned by You, and You shall not have any rights to such End User Data.  If DR or its service providers provides You with or makes accessible to You any End User Data, You shall only use such End User Data for the purpose for which it was provided to You under this Agreement.  With respect to any End User Data provided to You or made accessible to You by DR or its service providers, You agree that You: (a) shall comply with all applicable privacy legislation and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, handle such End User Data in full compliance with Your privacy policy; (b) shall use best efforts to ensure the confidentiality of such End User Data via encryption or similar means; and (c) shall not use such End User Data to offer any of Your products or services to such End Users or any other party in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) or other applicable laws, rules or regulations.  If You provide End User Data to DR or its service providers, You represent and warrant that You will have obtained any necessary consent from the End User to disclose the End User Data to DR and/or its service providers.  Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict You from using for Your lawful business purposes (in compliance with Your privacy policy) any data provided to You directly by an End User in connection with that End User&rsquo;s registration or use of an Application, provided that in all events You comply with all applicable privacy legislation.
                        
                        F.  Support.  You are solely responsible for, and agree to provide, (a) reasonable operational and technical support and assistance to End Users in connection with their installation/un-installation, use, and operation of Your Applications made available through the DR Commerce Solution, (b) reasonable operational and technical support and assistance to End Users in connection with their access to and use of a Service for which DR resells a corresponding Service Use Entitlement, and (c) a warranty for Your Application which is at a minimum consistent with the requirements of the laws in the jurisdiction of the End User.  You must provide to DR, by means of the Vendor Portal, with, at a minimum, an email address for technical and operational support.  Please note that neither DR nor RIM will provide software help-desk or other forms of technical support concerning Your Application, or a Service associated with a Service Use Entitlement resold by DR. DR&rsquo;s support (which may be provided by RIM on DR&rsquo;s behalf) is limited to assistance to End Users with the use of the DR Commerce Solution. 
                        
                        G.  Export.  As requested by DR, You agree to provide to DR, through the Vendor Portal or by email to export@digitalriver.com as requested by DR, with current, up-to-date and specific codes and classifications through the Vendor Portal or other related information, under any export control laws applicable to any Application (or Service corresponding to a Service Use Entitlement) that is made, or that You wish to have made, available through the DR Commerce Solution (including without limitation provision of appropriate Export Control Classification Numbers (&ldquo;ECCNs&rdquo;) and license exception codes).  The DR Commerce Solution is designed only to accept Applications and usage rights for Services that meet, among others, the following criteria: (1) generally available to the public by being sold, without restriction, from stock at retail selling points by electronic transactions; (2) designed for installation, access and/or use by the End User without further substantial support by the supplier; and if applicable (3) the cryptographic functionality cannot be easily changed by the End User. You agree You may not submit Applications that do not meet the above criteria. You are solely responsible for obtaining any government related export, import, use, supply and/or transfer permits (collectively, &ldquo;Export Permits&rdquo;) required for any Applications and related Services and shall obtain all such Export Permits prior to submitting any such Applications to DR and/or its service providers.  In no event shall DR and/or its service providers be required to obtain any Export Permit needed to receive or allow the download of any Application or use of any associated Service, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by DR.  You agree that You will not submit Applications which require a US Government review prior to availability without also submitting at the same time a valid Commodity Classification Tracking System (CCATS) number.
                        
                        Federal agencies have also banned or regulated trade between U.S. entities and certain organizations, businesses and persons. DR (either directly or through RIM on DR&rsquo;s behalf) retains the right to make its own determination, at its sole discretion, as to whether any proposed sales transaction might put DR and/or its service providers in violation of any applicable laws, rules and regulations which control, regulate, prohibit or otherwise affect the export, import or use of Your Application to or within the country to which the Application will be fulfilled, and may refuse to engage in any such Transactions without prior notice to You.
                        
                        H.  DR&rsquo;s Trademarks; Publicity.  DR&rsquo;s trademarks, service marks and business names (DR&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trademarks&rdquo;) are owned or licensed solely and exclusively by DR and its licensors. You may not make any press release regarding this Agreement which includes DR&rsquo;s name, logo, or otherwise refers to DR, or use DR&rsquo;s name or logo to refer to DR, or use DR&rsquo;s Trademarks, without DR&rsquo;s express prior written consent to do so (for the avoidance of doubt, You may issue a press release indicating that Your Application is available through the Blackberry App World without DR&rsquo;s consent, provided such press release does not use DR&rsquo;s name, logo, or DR&rsquo;s Trademarks, or otherwise refer to DR).  Any use by You of DR&rsquo;s Trademarks shall inure solely to DR&rsquo;s benefit. You agree, upon DR&rsquo;s demand, to promptly stop or alter any of Your uses of DR&rsquo;s Trademarks which DR deems to be improper or which may have the potential to put DR&rsquo;s Trademark rights at risk.
                        
                        I.  Fulfillment.  If necessary in order for DR to reproduce Your Application(s) and deliver same to End Users, You will cooperate with the reasonable requests of DR and RIM (who will be providing delivery and ancillary fulfillment services on behalf of DR) in relation to their fulfilling orders for copies of Your Application(s) to End Users.  With respect to Service Use Entitlements resold by DR, You expressly agree and acknowledge that DR is reselling an intangible right to access, use, and/or participate in the corresponding Service or Subscription-Based Application for a specified usage duration and is not the provider of such Service or Subscription-Based Application, and that You shall be solely responsible for fulfilling, operating and providing each Service or Subscription-Based Application for which DR resells a Service Use Entitlement.  
                        
                        4.  PAYMENTS AND RETURNS 
                        
                        A.  Sale of Copies of Applications. For each copy of Your Application that DR sells to an End User, DR will purchase that copy from You for the DR Purchase Price.  All amounts which DR owes You for the sale of copies of Your Applications shall be placed in a general in-house account maintained by DR (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not be an account specific to You), and DR will pay You from that account as described below.  You will not be entitled to interest on amounts held in DR&rsquo;s general in house account while such amounts are in DR&rsquo;s possession.
                        
                        B.  Taxes.  The DR Purchase Price paid to You for sales of copies of Your Applications shall be inclusive of any applicable sales or use, value added and/or other consumption-based taxes (&ldquo;B2B Taxes&rdquo;).  If there are any B2B Taxes which You are required to collect from DR on Your sale of a copy of an Application to DR, You will be solely responsible for the payment of any and all such applicable B2B Taxes (or Your income derived therefrom) from the DR Purchase Price amounts paid to You by DR. You agree that You shall not have any right to separately invoice DR for B2B Taxes on Your sale of a copy of an Application to DR, except that where law requires a separate invoice of any B2B Taxes, you shall have the right to send any such invoices to DR, marked &ldquo;paid&rdquo; as DR&rsquo;s payment of any amounts in such invoice(s) shall be considered already paid as part of the DR Purchase Price due to You from DR. In the event DR determines that withholding taxes are applicable to any payments due to You from DR, You agree and acknowledge that such payments by DR shall be net of any applicable withholding taxes.  You shall provide to DR all data reasonably necessary for DR to support any B2B Taxes included in the purchase price of a copy of an Application.  For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall DR be deemed to be providing tax advice or consulting services to You.  You shall be solely responsible for, and shall hold DR harmless from and against, the calculation of B2B Taxes due from DR on Your sale of a copy of an Application to DR, and any failure to collect B2B Taxes from DR on Your sale of a copy of an Application to DR at the time of sale to DR (including without limitation interest and penalties that result from any failure).
                        
                        C.  Returns and Refunds.  DR, as the seller and merchant of record for the DR Commerce Solution, is responsible for setting and applying the returns and cancellations policy applicable to the DR Commerce Solution.  If DR, at its option, provides a right of return or cancellation for Applications made available through the DR Commerce Solution, and DR accepts the return of an Application or cancellation of a Service Use Entitlement in accordance with such right of return, You shall also accept the return of that particular copy of the Application, and shall refund the amount paid to You by DR in relation to that Application to DR, at DR&rsquo;s option, either by paying this sum to DR (either through Your PayPal account or as otherwise agreed by DR) or by way of DR setting off this amount against other monies otherwise owing to You.  You will promptly (but in no event in less than twenty-four (24) hours) process any cancellation or non-renewal of a Service Use Entitlement once You have been notified of such cancellation or non-renewal.  You further agree and acknowledge that DR will treat any non-fraudulent Chargeback or other non-fraudulent End User-, bank- or payment processor-initiated reversal of a previously completed payment as a validly accepted return and a refund validly provided by DR.
                        
                        D.  Chargebacks, Fraud and Suppressed Orders.  A &ldquo;Chargeback&rdquo; is another form of refund that happens when PayPal, a credit card processor, or acquiring bank unilaterally revokes a prior transaction, which may be done under the rules of PayPal, the credit card banking system for such reasons as fraud or suspected fraud, End User complaint, or other reasons determined at the sole discretion of PayPal, the credit card processors and/or banks. DR makes no promises to You as to whether or how PayPal, credit card processors and/or banks will interpret their rules or rights concerning Chargebacks. You acknowledge that PayPal and credit and debit card transactions through the DR Commerce Solution are &lsquo;non-swiped,&rsquo; &lsquo;card not present&rsquo; Transactions and have no physical signature from an End User, and thus are subject to a higher level of Chargeback activity compared to physical credit card Transactions with wet-ink signatures.  
                        
                        For each Chargeback or other payment reversal in relation to a copy of Your Applications sold through the DR Commerce Solution, You agree to allow DR to offset the amount of such Chargebacks and payment reversals against amounts due to You from DR, or invoice You for such amounts if DR is unable to offset such amounts. (For the avoidance of doubt, DR will be responsible for any chargeback processing fees imposed by a bank or payment processor, but not for the amount charged back.)  Further, any sale of a copy of an Application where the fulfillment of that copy of the Application has been made by or on behalf of DR upon receipt of a valid payment authorization but is subsequently rejected or cancelled prior to settlement by DR, the merchant bank or payment processor, will not be treated as a completed sale to an End User by DR for the purposes of calculating payments due to You.  This paragraph shall survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement.
                        
                        E.  Payment Method and Frequency.  Within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of each calendar month (except as otherwise stated below):  (1) DR will make available to You a report in csv or similar format which shows each Transaction involving the sale of a copy of Your Application(s) for which DR processed payment during that calendar month and the calculation of the DR Purchase Price for the copy of the Application sold in each such Transaction, and the aggregate amount of DR Purchase Price amounts for that calendar month; and (2) DR will send to You a payment of accrued DR Purchase Price amounts on sales of copies of Your Applications, net of returns, chargebacks, applicable withholding taxes, and other amounts due to DR under this Agreement (&ldquo;Due Amounts&rdquo;).  You acknowledge that DR may split payment of a Due Amount into multiple contemporaneous payments based on PayPal requirements.  Payments shall be made to You via PayPal or such other payment method as may be offered to you at DR&rsquo;s sole discretion.  DR&rsquo;s payment obligations to You are subject to the following:
                        
                        (1)  DR may determine to hold back all or a portion of Your Due Amounts if DR has a reasonable basis to believe that it will likely be necessary to cover future refunds, charges against Your account, or other liabilities You may owe to DR. DR may also hold back all or a portion of Your Due Amounts if DR believes that the funds represent fraudulent transactions or involve other kinds of illegal activities. DR will only hold back those amounts which DR determines are reasonable under the circumstances. DR&rsquo;s statements or other communication from DR will note how much DR is holding back. DR will keep any held back amounts only for a reasonable time as determined in DR&rsquo;s sole discretion, and will promptly pay to You any remaining held back amounts after that reasonable time has passed. Regardless of any hold back DR may choose to keep, You agree to pay DR, upon demand, for any shortfall owed to DR due to refunds, Chargebacks, fraud, suppressed orders, or other fees for services rendered if they cannot be offset from Your account within ninety (90) calendar days of the date DR first seeks to offset such charges. If DR actually keeps (or sets off) any of the funds DR has held back against amounts due to You, DR will do so in a manner that DR believes fairly reflects Your liability owed to DR, and DR will note the set-off and provide You with an explanation of the set-off. DR shall be entitled to set off, against any holdback funds, any amount needed to reimburse DR for DR&rsquo;s costs or expenses of defending against any claims against DR related to Your breach of this Agreement, including an amount to pay any attorneys&rsquo; fees DR incurs associated with any such claims. 
                        
                        (2)  Any and all amounts payable to You under this Agreement shall be paid to You in the currency or currencies indicated in the Vendor Portal from time to time (as of April 2010 the only payment currency available to You is United States Dollars (USD)), and shall be paid into Your PayPal account, or by such other DR authorized payment method as may be made available from time to time.
                        
                        (3)  You may not request that DR make payments of Due Amounts to a third party on Your behalf.
                        
                        (4)  If You do not object in writing to amounts retained by DR within thirty (30) calendar days of a given payment of a Due Amount from which such amounts are retained, or to an invoiced amount by the payment due date specified on the invoice, You shall be deemed to have acknowledged the correctness of that invoice or amount and to have waived its right to dispute that invoice or amount. Your dispute as to a portion of any invoice or amount owed shall give You the right to withhold or delay payment of only the disputed amount of such invoice or amount owed, and not the undisputed portion. 
                        
                        5.	REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS
                        
                        A.  Mutual.  You and DR each make the following representations, warranties and covenants to the other: 
                        
                        (1)  it has full right, power and authority to enter into and fully perform its obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation the right to bind any party it purports to bind to this Agreement.
                        
                        (2)  its execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement do not conflict with any other agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound.
                        
                        B.  By You.  You make the following additional representations, warranties and covenants to DR: 
                        
                        (1)  You are the owner or fully authorized licensee of all intellectual property and other proprietary rights to Your Applications submitted through the Vendor Portal and to any Service for which DR resells a Service Use Entitlement, and have all rights necessary to grant the rights granted to DR hereunder and to allow DR to sell copies of Your Application to End Users.  DR&rsquo;s sale of copies of Your Applications to End Users on Authorized Networks will not violate any laws concerning export over national borders, including laws involving encryption technology.
                        
                        (2)  To the best of Your knowledge, the offer to sell, sale, use, copy, import, storage and/or distribution of Your Applications or copies thereof and associated Services for which DR resells Service Use Entitlement, by DR, or by third parties on behalf of DR, as contemplated hereunder, will not infringe, violate, or misuse, or constitute a misappropriation of, any third party&rsquo;s intellectual property or other proprietary rights anywhere in the world. 
                        (3)  The Applications You submit through the Vendor Portal, and any content and materials You provided in connection with these Applications, are not subject to licensing or usage fees to You which DR would be required to pay or any third party for which DR may be liable or responsible for payment.  Any content and materials You provide through the Vendor Portal or otherwise in connection with Your Applications being made available through the DR Commerce Solution are accurate, and do not violate any applicable laws or regulations concerning advertising claims or other forms of consumer protection laws. 
                        
                        (4)  The Applications You submit through the Vendor Portal, including all content within and/or made available directly or indirectly by means of the Applications, and each Service accessible in connection with a Service Use Entitlement resold by DR, is not libelous, does not slander others, does not contain obscene or pornographic material, is not illegal to use and does not otherwise violate the BlackBerry App World Guidelines in effect at the time of submitting each Application.

The Applications You submit through the Vendor Portal, and the Services accessible in connection with Service Use Entitlements, are not designed or usable as a tool for processing e-mail for mass mailing (&ldquo;spamming&rdquo; tools or the like). 
                        
                        (5)  With respect to any promotion by You of Your Applications that are made available through the DR Commerce Solution or associated Services, You will not display any inaccurate or misleading information concerning Your identity or location, or inaccurate or misleading information concerning the role of DR as the seller and merchant of record to the End User for purchases of copies of Your Applications. 
                        
                        (6)  You will not engage in deceptive trade practices, or directly solicit End Users or potential End Users  who have not affirmatively consented to receive direct solicitations from You, or otherwise violate any laws, rules or regulations applicable to the sale of copies of Your Application through the DR Commerce Solution to End Users on Authorized Networks and the conduct of Your business.
                        
                        (7)  You will not use commercial e-mail (solicited or unsolicited) to market Your Application or associated Service if that use of commercial e-mail violates any applicable laws or regulations regarding the use of commercial e-mail. You will comply with any legal obligations to provide proper labeling and content within Your marketing e mails, and to provide opt-in or opt-out capabilities to recipients and comply with any such requests. Subject to any approvals required pursuant to Section 3(H) above, any advertising or other marketing materials that mention DR, the BlackBerry App World, or the DR Commerce Solution, or which contain hyperlinks to the DR Commerce Solution or BlackBerry App World, must be in compliance with all laws concerning advertising and marketing for the territories where You deliver those materials. You are responsible for compliance with all of the above, whether You provide the e-mails or advertisements on Your own or use the services of a third party.
                        
                        (8)  You are the owner, licensor and/or distributor of the Applications and associated Services with all rights necessary to allow DR to purchase copies of the Applications (or in the case of a Service, a Service Use Entitlement) from You for resale. 
                        (9)  The Applications (and Services for which DR resells a corresponding Service Use Entitlement) are designed for access, operation and use on RIM proprietary software operating on wireless handheld devices.
                        
                        C.  By DR.  DR makes the following additional representations, warranties and covenants to You:
                        
                        (1)  Except to the extent that this prohibition is precluded by law, DR shall not modify any Application without Your express written permission, and may not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any Application. 
                        
                        6.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; INDEMNITY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
                        
                        A.  Disclaimer of Warranties.  Except as expressly set out herein,  DR provides DR&rsquo;s valued added reseller services to You on an &ldquo;AS-IS, AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; basis and makes no promises as to the percentage up-time of the Vendor Portal, BlackBerry App World or DR Commerce Solution, or that the Vendor Portal, BlackBerry App World or DR Commerce Solution will operate completely without error.  The Vendor Portal, BlackBerry App World and DR Commerce Solution are subject to change without notice.  DR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING THE QUALITY OR AVAILABILITY OF THE VENDOR PORTAL, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD OR DR COMMERCE SOLUTION AND ANY OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY DR PURSUANT OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON INFRINGEMENT.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, DR DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM OR REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY OR CONTENT OF THE DR COMMERCE SOLUTION, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD, VENDOR PORTAL, AND/OR DR ADMINISTRATIVE INTERFACE OR ANY INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE THEREON, OR ANY ECONOMIC BENEFIT YOU MAY GAIN FROM YOUR USE OF, OR INCLUSION OF YOUR APPLICATIONS ON, THE SAME.    DR DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT THE VENDOR PORTAL, DR COMMERCE SOLUTION, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD AND ADMINISTRATIVE INTEFACE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR MALICIOUS CONTENT DESPITE ANY EFFORTS BY DR AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PREVENT THE INCLUSION OF SUCH CONTENT, AND YOU ACCEPT ALL RISK AND LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE VENDOR PORTAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INTERFACE.  NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS A GUARANTEE, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE LEVEL OF SALES OF COPIES OF YOUR APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CAN EXPECT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  
                        
                        DR FURTHER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE ACTS AND OMISSIONS OF ANY AND ALL THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROVISION OF THE VENDOR PORTAL, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD OR DR COMMERCE SOLUTION OR THE PURCHASE OF COPIES OF  YOUR APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE PROVISION OF THE VENDOR PORTAL AND BLACKBERRY APP WORLD  AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO DR BY RIM, AND THE USE, SALE OR REDISTRIBUTION OF AN APPLICATION  BY AN END USER (WHETHER OR NOT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE EULA).
                        
                        EXCEPT FOR ANY OBLIGATIONS DR HAS UNDER SECTION 5(C)(1) OR ITS OBLIGATIONS TO PAY YOU THE DUE AMOUNTS (SUBJECT TO THE HOLD BACK PROVISIONS OF SECTION 4(E)(1) YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY DR, OR FOR YOUR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE VENDOR PORTAL, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD OR DR COMMERCE SOLUTION OR THE SALE OF COPIES OF YOUR APPLICATIONS PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, IS FOR YOU TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT.
                        
                        B.  Indemnity.  You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless DR and its service providers, their successors and assigns, and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, from and against any and all demands, judgments, losses, costs, expenses, obligations, liabilities, damages, fines, recoveries and deficiencies, including without limitation interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs (collectively, &ldquo;Losses&rdquo;) in connection with a claim, action, suit or proceeding made, brought or commenced by a third party other than an affiliate of the indemnified Party (each, a &ldquo;Claim&rdquo;), that any such party may incur or suffer, which arise, result from, or relate to:  (i) Your breach of any of Your obligations, representations, warranties or covenants made by You hereunder, (ii) the actual or alleged infringement by Your Applications or copies thereof, or other materials provided by You of any third party proprietary or intellectual property rights, or (iii) any liability arising from an End User&rsquo;s use of Your Applications or any Service in connection with which DR resells a Service Use Entitlement.  The indemnified party will promptly notify You in writing of any Claim and will provide You all disclosable information in its possession (at the indemnified party&rsquo;s expense) and reasonable assistance (at Your sole expense) as reasonably necessary to evaluate and defend such Claim, and the authority to settle and/or defend such Claim only in accordance with the following sentence.  You shall obtain each indemnified party&rsquo;s express prior written approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to settle any Claim if such settlement (a) arises from or is part of any criminal action, suit or proceeding, or (b) contains a stipulation to or admission or acknowledgment of any liability or wrongdoing on the part of that indemnified party, or (c) requires any specific performance or non pecuniary remedy by that indemnified party, or (d) requires the actual payment of any amount by that indemnified party.  This indemnity shall survive termination of this Agreement.
                        
                        C.  Limitation of Liability.  EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM DR&rsquo;S OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT (INCLUDING A WILLFUL BREACH OF SECTION 5(C)(1)), DR SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON OR ORGANIZATION FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, DELAY OF DELIVERY, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY DESCRIPTION, HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NUMBER OR NATURE OF CLAIMS.  
                        
                        EXCEPT FOR ANY OBLIGATIONS DR HAS TO PAY YOU THE DUE AMOUNTS (SUBJECT TO THE HOLD BACK PROVISIONS OF SECTION 4(E)(1)) OR FOR DR&rsquo;S OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT (INCLUDING A WILLFUL BREACH OF SECTION 5(C)(1)), IF, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, DR, OR ITS SERVICE  PROVIDERS, IS HELD LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM, RELATING TO OR RESULTING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, THE SALE OF COPIES OF YOUR APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE DR COMMERCE SOLUTION, OR OTHERWISE FROM OUR RELATIONSHIP, DR&rsquo;S AGGREGATE AND ENTIRE LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL BE LIMITED TO AND SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).
                        
                        D.  Other.  THE LIMITATIONS UPON DAMAGES AND CLAIMS, AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT FORM A FUNDAMENTAL AND ESSENTIAL PART OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THEM, AND ARE INTENDED TO APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE BEEN HELD TO BE INVALID OR INEFFECTIVE AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.

                        7.	TERM AND TERMINATION
                        
                        A. Term.  This Agreement starts on the date DR acknowledges its acceptance of this Agreement as set forth herein, and will last until either You or DR terminates this Agreement as set forth herein.  You  may terminate this Agreement with or without cause by providing DR with no less than thirty (30) calendar days prior notice in writing of Your decision to terminate.   In the event You are in material breach of this Agreement or have failed to perform any of Your material obligations under this Agreement, and have not cured such breach or failure within fourteen (14) calendar days of being notified by DR of such breach or failure, DR may terminate this Agreement on notice to You without further opportunity to cure.  Further, DR may, at any time, terminate this Agreement by delivering to You notice of its decision to do so, if: (a) DR ceases to operate the DR Commerce Solution in connection with the Blackberry App World; (b) DR is required to do so by law; (c) You, or if You have licensed the distribution rights for the Applications, the licensor(s) for those Applications, has entered into  a software development agreement: (i) with RIM that is no longer in good standing, that provides for the use of at least one of RIM&rsquo;s development tools listed at http://us.blackberry.com/developers/sdks.jsp and (ii) if applicable, in the case of themes, with Plazmic Inc. (Plazmic) that is no longer in good standing that provides for the use of Plazmic&rsquo;s Content Developer&rsquo;s Kit (CDK); or (d) You are not in good standing with DR or RIM (other than due to a breach of this Agreement in which case the cure period set forth above shall apply).
                        
                        B.  Termination.  Upon termination of this Agreement:  (a) You will immediately cease any use of DR&rsquo;s name, logos or Trademarks, and remove any approved hyperlinks to the DR Commerce Solution that deal with the sale of copies of Your Application; (b) DR will promptly halt any sale of copies of Your Application(s) through the DR Commerce Solution; (c) DR will continue to make payments to You of amounts due to You under this Agreement, on the regular pay cycle dates, until the time that Your account has reached a zero balance (DR&rsquo;s hold back rights as described in Section 4(E)(1) above, and Your obligation to pay DR for any shortfall in Your account, shall survive the termination of the Agreement); (d) You will continue to provide access to Services in accordance with purchased Service Use Entitlements for the remainder of the subscription period(s) of such Service Use Entitlements; and (e) You will continue to be responsible for any liability that might arise out of Chargebacks, any infringement of intellectual property rights, any violation of laws, rules or regulations that may have occurred as a result of copies of Your Applications or access to Services being made available via the DR Commerce Solution, and any breach by You of the terms of this Agreement.
                        
                        C.  Survival.  The provisions of this Agreement which, by their terms, require performance after the termination of this Agreement, or have application to events that may occur after the termination of this Agreement, shall survive the termination of this Agreement, which provisions shall include without limitation sections 1, 2, 3(A), 3(D), 3(E), 3(F), 3(G), 4, 5, 6, 7(B), 7(C), and 8.
                        
                        8.	MISCELLANEOUS
                        
                        A.  Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the BlackBerry App World Guidelines sets forth the entire understanding between You and DR with respect to its subject matter, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous proposals, communications, agreements, understandings, negotiations, and representations, whether written or oral, related thereto.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.  However, You may not assign this Agreement, or any of Your rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise) without DR&rsquo;s express prior written permission to do so, and any attempt to assign in violation of the preceding shall be null and void and such attempt shall constitute an incurable material breach of this Agreement. 
                        
                        B.  Changes to this Agreement. As this agreement has no specified term, and business circumstances and legal requirements may change from time to time, DR reserves the right to revise the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any such revisions that are material in nature, DR will provide You with notice of such revised version in accordance with section 8(F), otherwise DR may provide notice by posting the revised version of the Agreement on the Vendor Portal.  Any revisions to the Agreement which are required in order to comply with legal requirements, or changes in legal requirements, will immediately become effective as of the date DR provides notice to You.  All other revisions to the Agreement will become effective thirty (30) calendar days after DR provides notice to You of such revisions.  Except as set forth above, no conditions other than those set forth in this Agreement, or amendments or modifications to this Agreement, shall be binding on DR unless DR expressly agrees to such amendments or modifications in a writing signed by an authorized representative of DR.
                        
                        C.  Relationship of the Parties. You and DR are independent contractors of, and not an employee, agent or authorized representative of, the other. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee relationship, or other business combination between You and DR is intended or created by this Agreement.  Neither party shall have the right, power or authority to act or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of each other.  Without limiting the foregoing, neither party shall make any representations or warranties to third parties on behalf of the other party.  RIM and its affiliates shall be considered third party beneficiaries of sections 3(A), 3(C), 3(D), and 6 of this Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce these sections with respect to RIM and its affiliates only. There are no other third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement.
                        
                        D.  Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of  New York, United States of America, without respect to or application of its conflicts-of-laws provisions.   The parties specifically disclaim application of :  (i) the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods; and (ii) of Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code as codified.  If there are any disputes or conflicts related to or arising out of this Agreement, You and DR shall use reasonable means to resolve the conflict prior to starting any lawsuits or other litigation, including negotiation between management personnel capable of resolving the conflicts. However, in the event either You or DR should start any litigation arising out of this Agreement, You expressly agree that the litigation will take place exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States of America, and You expressly agree that any such court has personal jurisdiction over You. You waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens.  Process may be served on either party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.
                        
                        E.  Waiver; Severability.

                        (5)	You shall provide a Suggested Retail Price through the Vendor Portal for copies of each of the Applications which You wish to make available through the BANGO Commerce Solution.  The Suggested Retail Price may only be provided to BANGO in up to the number of currencies and only in the currencies and in the manner indicated in the Vendor Portal from time to time.  For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the Vendor Portal, while You may provide Suggested Retail Prices for copies of Your Applications, BANGO is solely responsible for setting the price at which copies of Your Application will be sold by BANGO through the BANGO Commerce Solution, which may reflect Your Suggested Retail Price at BANGO's sole discretion.
                        
                        (6)	You will not submit through the Vendor Portal any products other than Applications (such as but not limited to products which are fulfilled physically), unless otherwise agreed to in writing by You and BANGO.

                        3.	GENERAL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT
                        
                        A.  Submitting Applications; Approval Process.  You will submit to BANGO, through the Vendor Portal, each Application You would like BANGO to make available through the BANGO Commerce Solution, together with such information as is requested by BANGO, or on BANGO&rsquo;s behalf by RIM (which in the case of a Service Use Entitlement includes information on the corresponding Service), by means of the Vendor Portal or otherwise, in connection with such Application (including by way of example and not limitation, the Authorized Network(s), the name of the Application, a description of the Application, compatibility and resource requirements for the Application, a copy of the executable Application for testing, and the Suggested Retail Price of the Application).  Your submission of an Application through the Vendor Portal constitutes Your request for BANGO to sell copies of such Application through the BANGO Commerce Solution.  BANGO and RIM shall have the right to review and test such Application (and associated Service where applicable) to ensure conformance with the Blackberry App World Guidelines before offering Your Application for sale through the BANGO Commerce Solution, but shall have no obligation to do so.  You understand and acknowledge that in order for Your Applications to be made available for sale through the BANGO Commerce Solution through the Blackberry App World, in addition to this Agreement You must enter into an agreement with BANGO's Service Provider RIM for, among other purposes, the purposes of evaluating and testing Your Applications.  The provision of notice to You that Your Application has been approved for resale through the BANGO Commerce Solution shall constitute approval of Your request for BANGO to sell copies of such Applications. BANGO and/or RIM, on BANGO's behalf, shall notify you if a submitted Application does not meet the BlackBerry App World Guidelines, or if BANGO has elected not to make available any of Your Applications through the BANGO Commerce Solution or to not make them available in specific jurisdictions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, You acknowledge that BANGO may, in BANGO's sole discretion with or without advance notice, decline to sell any one or more of Your Applications, at any time, at all, or in specific jurisdictions, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute BANGO's commitment or obligation to sell copies of Your Applications. You further acknowledge and agree that BANGO may, at any time, in BANGO's sole discretion and for any reason whatsoever, remove, or have removed, an Application from an End User&rsquo;s wireless handheld device and/or remove such Application from the End User&rsquo;s My World repository.
                        
                        B.  You acknowledge and agree that BANGO may sell applications, service entitlements, and/or other downloadable content provided by others that may be similar to or competitive with Your Applications and associated Services, and that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting You any exclusivity within the Blackberry App World with respect to any of Your Applications, Services Associated with Service Use Entitlements, and/or other downloadable content resold by BANGO. 
                        
                        C.  Legal Relationship; Sales of Copies of Your Applications.  As an owner, licensor and/or distributor of Applications, You will provide to BANGO, through the Vendor Portal, a master copy of Your Application to be made available to End Users through the Commerce Solution.  You hereby grant:  (a) to BANGO and RIM, the right to make copies of Your Applications for its own internal use and testing purposes, for the purposes of evaluating and ensuring Your Applications comply with the BlackBerry App World Guidelines, and for the purposes of RIM's provision of fulfillment and ancillary services as BANGO's fulfillment agent; and (b) to BANGO, the right (which right with respect to fulfillment may be sublicensed by BANGO to RIM or to another third party fulfillment Service Provider, at BANGO's option)  to make a copy of that Application when an order for an Application is placed through the BANGO Commerce Solution by an End User, which copy BANGO shall purchase from You and resell to that End User along with the right to use the Application or the right to use a Subscription-Based Application or Service corresponding to a Service Use Entitlement (which right to use is subject to the terms and conditions set out in Your EULA), and BANGO shall purchase such copy from You for the BANGO Purchase Price on the terms set forth in this Agreement.  You grant to BANGO a worldwide right to use the materials and information You provide in connection with each such Application to facilitate BANGO's sale of copies of each such Application through the BANGO Commerce Solution and the provision of related services by RIM.  You further agree to comply with the terms of all agreements entered into between You and RIM.  BANGO and/or RIM shall have full control over the design, operation, features and functionality (including available End User payment methods) and End User terms and policies applicable to the Blackberry App World and BANGO Commerce Solution.  Title to a copy of an Application sold through the BANGO Commerce Solution to an End User shall pass from BANGO to that End User upon the completion of both:  (a) BANGO's receipt of payment for that Application; (b) the provision to the End User of access to download the Application.  You will not offer Service Use Entitlements to BANGO for BANGO&rsquo;s resale to any country or jurisdiction where access to the corresponding Service or Subscription-Based Application is prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation.
                        
                        D.  Your EULA.  You shall include the EULA under which You wish to license Your Applications within Your Application for the particular jurisdictions in which the Application is to be made available.  This EULA shall at minimum, include provisions excluding BANGO and RIM (not necessarily by name, but at least by role, e.g. channel partners and associated Service Providers) from any liability whatsoever in relation to Your Application, including without limitation in relation to the sale or use of copies thereof, or the performance or non-performance of Your Applications, shall make BANGO and RIM third party beneficiaries to the EULA with respect to these provision(s), and shall include an email address (and may include a phone number) through which End Users can obtain support from You as required by Section 3.F below.  Further, the EULA shall also indicate any jurisdictions in which End Users may not use an Application, and shall identify any export restrictions.  BANGO shall not remove, or have removed, any EULA from any Application or copy thereof, and shall state in its terms of sale to the End User, that their right to use the copy of the Application sold to them is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the EULA in Your Application.  You agree and acknowledge that any EULA You enter into with an End User is an agreement between You and the End User, and BANGO shall not be a party to that EULA, unless BANGO is in the role of an End User of Your Applications.  Notwithstanding any provision in Your EULA, You acknowledge and agree that BANGO may make it a term of sale to an End User who obtains a copy of Your Application through the BANGO Commerce Solution that the Application be downloaded, installed and/or used only on a RIM proprietary handheld software platform on a wireless handheld device.  You shall not include any provision in Your EULA that imposes any obligations on BANGO or its Service Providers.
                        
                        E.  End User Data.  Because BANGO is the reseller to End Users of copies of Your Applications, BANGO is the party with whom the End User is transacting business for each Transaction.  As such, the End User is giving his/her/its End User Data to BANGO.  You agree that End User Data obtained in connection with a Transaction shall not be owned by You, and You shall not have any rights to such End User Data.  If BANGO or its Service Providers provide You with or make accessible to You any End User Data, You shall only use such End User Data for the purpose for which it was provided to You under this Agreement.  With respect to any End User Data  provided to You or made accessible to You by BANGO or its Service Providers, You agree that You:  (a) shall comply with all applicable privacy legislation and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, handle such End User Data in full compliance with Your privacy policy; (b) shall use best efforts to ensure the confidentiality of such End User Data via encryption or similar means; and (c) shall not use such End User Data to offer any of Your products or services to such End Users or any other party in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) or other applicable laws, rules or regulations.  If You provide End User Data to BANGO or its Service Providers, You represent and warrant that You will have obtained any necessary consent from the End User to disclose the End User Data to BANGO and/or its Service Providers.  Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict You from using for Your lawful business purposes (in compliance with Your privacy policy) any data provided to You directly by an End User in connection with that End User's registration or use of an Application, provided that in all events You comply with all applicable privacy legislation. 
                        
                        F.  Support.  You are solely responsible for, and agree to provide, (a) reasonable operational and technical support and assistance to End Users in connection with their installation/un-installation, use, and operation of Your Applications made available through the BANGO Commerce Solution, (b) reasonable operational and technical support and assistance to End Users in connection with their access to and use of a Service for which BANGO resells a corresponding Service Use Entitlement, and (c) a warranty for Your Application which is at a minimum consistent with the requirements of the laws in the jurisdiction of the End User.  You must provide to BANGO, by means of the Vendor Portal, with, at a minimum, an email address for technical and operational support.  Please note that neither BANGO nor RIM will provide software help-desk or other forms of technical support concerning Your Application, or a Service associated with a Service Use Entitlement resold by BANGO. BANGO's support (which may be provided by RIM on BANGO's behalf) is limited to assistance to End Users with the use of the BANGO Commerce Solution.
                        
                        G.  Export.  As requested by BANGO, You agree to provide to BANGO, through the Vendor Portal or by email to support@bango.com as requested by BANGO, with current, up-to-date and specific codes and classifications through the Vendor Portal or other related information, under any export control laws applicable to any Application (or Service corresponding to a Service Use Entitlement) that is made, or that You wish to have made, available through the BANGO Commerce Solution (including without limitation provision of appropriate Export Control Classification Numbers (&quot;ECCNs&quot;) and license exception codes).  The BANGO Commerce Solution is designed only to accept Applications and usage rights for Services that meet, among others, the following criteria: (1) generally available to the public by being sold, without restriction, from stock at retail selling points by electronic transactions; (2) designed for installation, access and/or use by the End User without further substantial support by the supplier; and if applicable (3) the cryptographic functionality cannot be easily changed by the End User. You agree You may not submit Applications that do not meet the above criteria. You are solely responsible for obtaining any government related export, import, use, supply and/or transfer permits (collectively, &quot;Export Permits&quot;) required for any Applications and related Services and shall obtain all such Export Permits prior to submitting any such Applications to BANGO and/or its Service Providers.  In no event shall BANGO and/or its Service Providers be required to obtain any Export Permit needed to receive or allow the download of any Application or use of any associated Service, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by BANGO.  You agree that You will not submit Applications which require a US Government review prior to availability without also submitting at the same time a valid Commodity Classification Tracking System (CCATS) number.
                        
                        Federal agencies have also banned or regulated trade between U.S. entities and certain organizations, businesses and persons. BANGO (either directly or through RIM on BANGO's behalf) retains the right to make its own determination, at its sole discretion, as to whether any proposed sales transaction might put BANGO and/or its Service Providers in violation of any applicable laws, rules and regulations which control, regulate, prohibit or otherwise affect the export, import or use of Your Application to or within the country to which the Application will be fulfilled, and may refuse to engage in any such Transactions without prior notice to You.
                        
                        H.  BANGO's Trademarks; Publicity.  BANGO's trademarks, service marks and business names (BANGO's &quot;Trademarks&quot;) are owned or licensed solely and exclusively by BANGO and its licensors. You may not make any press release regarding this Agreement which includes BANGO's name, logo, or otherwise refers to BANGO, or use BANGO's name or logo to refer to BANGO, or use BANGO's Trademarks, without BANGO's express prior written consent to do so (for the avoidance of doubt, You may issue a press release indicating that Your Application is available through the Blackberry App World without BANGO's consent, provided such press release does not use BANGO's name, logo, or BANGO's Trademarks, or otherwise refer to BANGO).  Any use by You of BANGO's Trademarks shall inure solely to BANGO's benefit. You agree, upon BANGO's demand, to promptly stop or alter any of Your uses of BANGO's Trademarks which BANGO deems to be improper or which may have the potential to put BANGO's Trademark rights at risk.
                        
                        I.  Fulfillment.  If necessary in order for BANGO to reproduce Your Application(s) and deliver same to End Users, You will cooperate with the reasonable requests of BANGO and RIM (who will be providing delivery and ancillary fulfillment services on behalf of BANGO) in relation to their fulfilling orders for copies of Your Application(s) to End Users.    With respect to Service Use Entitlements resold by BANGO, You expressly agree and acknowledge that BANGO is reselling an intangible right to access, use, and/or participate in the corresponding Service or Subscription-Based Application for a specified usage duration and is not the provider of such Service or Subscription-Based Application, and that You shall be solely responsible for fulfilling, operating and providing each Service or Subscription-Based Application for which BANGO resells a Service Use Entitlement.  
                        
                        4.	PAYMENTS AND RETURNS 
                        
                        A.  Sale of Copies of Applications.  For each copy of Your Application that BANGO sells to an End User, BANGO will purchase that copy from You for the BANGO Purchase Price.  All amounts which BANGO owes You for the sale of copies of Your Applications shall be placed in a general in-house account maintained by BANGO (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not be an account specific to You), and BANGO will pay You from that account as described below.  You will not be entitled to interest on amounts held in BANGO's general in-house account while such amounts are in BANGO's possession.
                        
                        B.  Taxes.  The BANGO Purchase Price paid to You for sales of copies of Your Applications shall be inclusive of any applicable  taxes (&quot;B2B Taxes&quot;).  If there are any B2B Taxes which You are required to collect from BANGO on Your sale of a copy of an Application to BANGO, You will be solely responsible for the payment of any and all such applicable B2B Taxes (or Your income derived therefrom) from the BANGO Purchase Price amounts paid to You by BANGO. You agree that You shall not have any right to separately invoice BANGO for B2B Taxes on Your sale of a copy of an Application to BANGO, except that where law requires a separate invoice of any B2B Taxes, you shall have the right to send any such invoices to BANGO, marked &quot;paid&quot; as BANGO's payment of any amounts in such invoice(s) shall be considered already paid as part of the BANGO Purchase Price due to You from BANGO. In the event BANGO determines that withholding taxes are applicable to any payments due to You from BANGO, You agree and acknowledge that such payments by BANGO shall be net of any applicable withholding taxes.  You shall provide to BANGO all data reasonably necessary for BANGO to support any B2B Taxes included in the purchase price of a copy of an Application.  For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall BANGO be deemed to be providing tax advice or consulting services to You.  You shall be solely responsible for, and shall hold BANGO harmless from and against, the calculation of B2B Taxes due from BANGO on Your sale of a copy of an Application to BANGO, and any failure to collect B2B Taxes from BANGO on Your sale of a copy of an Application to BANGO at the time of sale to BANGO (including without limitation interest and penalties that result from any failure).  If You are registered for VAT in the United Kingdom, You will need to provide to BANGO or to RIM, at BANGO&rsquo;s request, Your VAT number.  If Your VAT status should change, or You sell all or part of your business, You should notify Bango in writing, immediately.
                        
                        C.  Returns and Refunds.  BANGO, as the seller and merchant of record for the BANGO Commerce Solution, is responsible for setting and applying the returns and cancellations policy applicable to the BANGO Commerce Solution. 
                         If BANGO, at its option, provides a right of return or cancellation for Applications made available through the BANGO Commerce Solution, and BANGO accepts the return of an Application or cancellation of a Service Use Entitlement in accordance with such right of return, You shall also accept the return of that particular copy of the Application, and shall refund the amount paid to You by BANGO in relation to that Application to BANGO, at BANGO's option, either by paying this sum to BANGO (either through Your PayPal account or as otherwise agreed by BANGO) or by way of BANGO setting off this amount against other monies otherwise owing to You.  You will promptly (but in no event in less than twenty-four (24) hours) process any cancellation or non-renewal of a Service Use Entitlement once You have been notified of such cancellation or non-renewal.  You further agree and acknowledge that BANGO will treat any non-fraudulent Chargeback or other non-fraudulent End User-, bank- or payment processor-initiated reversal of a previously completed payment as a validly accepted return and a refund validly provided by BANGO.
                        
                        D.  Chargebacks, Fraud and Suppressed Orders.  A &quot;Chargeback&quot; is another form of refund that happens when a payment processor such as a mobile network operator (i.e. carrier),, a credit card processor, or acquiring bank unilaterally revokes a prior transaction, which may be done under the scheme rules of the mobile network operator, the credit card banking system for such reasons as fraud or suspected fraud, End User complaint, or other reasons determined at the sole discretion of the mobile network operator, the credit card processors and/or banks. BANGO makes no promises to You as to whether or how the mobile network operator, credit card processors and/or banks will interpret their rules or rights concerning Chargebacks. You acknowledge that mobile network operator and credit and debit card transactions through the BANGO Commerce Solution are 'non-swiped,' 'card-not-present' Transactions and have no physical signature from an End User, and thus are subject to a higher level of Chargeback activity compared to physical credit card Transactions with wet-ink signatures.  
                        
                        For each Chargeback or other payment reversal in relation to a copy of Your Applications sold through the BANGO Commerce Solution, You agree to allow BANGO to offset the amount of such Chargebacks and payment reversals against amounts due to You from BANGO, or invoice You for such amounts if BANGO is unable to offset such amounts. Further, any sale of a copy of an Application where the fulfillment of that copy of the Application has been made by or on behalf of BANGO upon receipt of a valid payment authorization but is subsequently rejected, cancelled or uncollectible from an end user (for example, due to the end user entering into a 'bad debt' situation) prior to settlement by BANGO, the merchant bank or payment processor, will not be treated as a completed sale to an End User by BANGO for the purposes of calculating payments due to You.  This paragraph shall survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement.
                        
                        E.  Payment Method and Frequency.  Within sixty (60) calendar days of the end of each calendar month (except as otherwise stated below):  (1) BANGO will make available to You a report in csv or similar format which shows each Transaction involving the sale of a copy of Your Application(s) for which BANGO processed payment during that calendar month and the calculation of the BANGO Purchase Price for the copy of the Application sold in each such Transaction, and the aggregate amount of BANGO Purchase Price amounts for that calendar month; and (2) BANGO will send to You a payment of accrued BANGO Purchase Price amounts on sales of copies of Your Applications, net of returns, chargebacks, applicable withholding taxes, and other amounts due to BANGO under this Agreement (&quot;Due Amounts&quot;).  You acknowledge that BANGO may split payment of a Due Amount into multiple contemporaneous payments based on Your settlement agent&rsquo;s (for example PayPal&rsquo;s) requirements. 
                        In order to relieve You of any requirement to produce Your own invoice to receive payments from BANGO under this Agreement, and to provide a standardized, efficient and timely settlement process, You hereby acknowledge and agree to a self-billing invoice system under which BANGO shall raise invoices. The self-billing invoice is a standardized document that BANGO produces each month on Your behalf, which shall serve as the sole invoice document for settlement under this Agreement.  You hereby acknowledge and agree that You shall not raise any invoices under or in relation to this Agreement.
                        Payments shall be made to You via PayPal or other means as determined by BANGO.  BANGO's payment obligations to You are subject to the following:
                        (1)  BANGO may determine to hold back all or a portion of Your Due Amounts if BANGO has a reasonable basis to believe that it will likely be necessary to cover future refunds, charges against Your account, or other liabilities You may owe to BANGO. BANGO may also hold back all or a portion of Your Due Amounts if BANGO believes that the funds represent fraudulent transactions or involve other kinds of illegal activities or represent erroneous transactions. BANGO will only hold back those amounts which BANGO determines are reasonable under the circumstances. BANGO's statements or other communication from BANGO will note how much BANGO is holding back. BANGO will keep any held back amounts only for a reasonable time as determined in BANGO's sole discretion, and will promptly pay to You any remaining held back amounts after that reasonable time has passed. Regardless of any hold back BANGO may choose to keep, You agree to pay BANGO, upon demand, for any shortfall owed to BANGO due to refunds, Chargebacks, fraud, suppressed orders, or other fees for services rendered if they cannot be offset from Your account within ninety (90) calendar days  of the date BANGO first seeks to offset such charges. If BANGO actually keeps (or sets off) any of the funds BANGO has held back against amounts due to You, BANGO will do so in a manner that BANGO believes fairly reflects Your liability owed to BANGO, and BANGO will note the set-off and provide You with an explanation of the set-off. BANGO shall be entitled to set off, against any holdback funds, any amount needed to reimburse BANGO for BANGO's costs or expenses of defending against any claims against BANGO related to Your breach of this Agreement, including an amount to pay any attorneys' fees BANGO incurs associated with any such claims.
                        
                        (2)  Any and all amounts payable to You under this Agreement shall be paid to You in the currency or currencies indicated in the Vendor Portal from time to time (as of April 2010 the only payment currency available to You is United States Dollars (USD)), and shall be paid into Your PayPal account, or by such other BANGO authorized payment method as may be made available from time to time.
                        
                        (3)  You may not request that BANGO make payments of Due Amounts to a third party on Your behalf.
                        
                        (4)  If You do not object in writing to amounts retained by BANGO within thirty (30) calendar days of a given payment of a Due Amount from which such amounts are retained, or to an invoiced amount by the payment due date specified on the invoice, You shall be deemed to have acknowledged the correctness of that invoice or amount and to have waived its right to dispute that invoice or amount. Your dispute as to a portion of any invoice or amount owed shall give You the right to withhold or delay payment of only the disputed amount of such invoice or amount owed, and not the undisputed portion. 
                        (5)  BANGO may withhold payment of the relevant part of a Due Amount until the payment is received from the payment processor. If Bango withholds any payment because of a delay in settlement from a payment processor, Bango will notify You if you are affected on or before the day that the payment to You is due to be made.
                        
                        (6)  BANGO may withhold payments of Due Amounts if the amount due to You is less than $100 (US Dollars) in any settlement period, until the amount due exceeds this sum.
                        
                        5.	REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS
                        
                        A.  Mutual.  You and BANGO each make the following representations, warranties and covenants to the other: 
                        
                        (1)  Each party has full right, power and authority to enter into and fully perform its obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation the right to bind any party it purports to bind to this Agreement.
                        
                        (2)  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement does not conflict with any other agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound.
                        
                        B.  By You.  You make the following additional representations, warranties and covenants to BANGO: 
                        
                        (1)  You are the owner or fully authorized licensee of all intellectual property and other proprietary rights to Your Applications submitted through the Vendor Portal and to any Service for which BANGO resells a Service Use Entitlement, and have all rights necessary to grant the rights granted to BANGO hereunder and to allow BANGO to sell copies of Your Application to End Users.  BANGO's sale of copies of Your Applications to End Users on Authorized Networks will not violate any laws concerning export over national borders, including laws involving encryption technology.
                        
                        (2)  To the best of Your knowledge, the offer to sell, sale, use, copy, import, storage and/or distribution of Your Applications or copies thereof and associated Services for which BANGO resells Service Use Entitlements, by BANGO, or by third parties on behalf of BANGO, as contemplated hereunder, will not infringe, violate, or misuse, or constitute a misappropriation of, any third party's intellectual property or other proprietary rights anywhere in the world.
                        
                        (3)  The Applications You submit through the Vendor Portal, and any content and materials You provided in connection with these Applications, are not subject to licensing or usage fees to You which BANGO would be required to pay or any third party for which BANGO may be liable or responsible for payment.  Any content and materials You provide through the Vendor Portal or otherwise in connection with Your Applications being made available through the BANGO Commerce Solution are accurate, and do not violate any applicable laws or regulations concerning advertising claims or other forms of consumer protection laws. 
                        
                        (4)  The Applications You submit through the Vendor Portal, including all content within and/or made available directly or indirectly by means of the Applications, and each Service accessible in connection with a Service Use Entitlement resold by BANGO, is not libelous, does not slander others, does not contain obscene or pornographic material, is not illegal to use and does not otherwise violate the BlackBerry App World Guidelines in effect at the time of submitting each Application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Applications You submit through the Vendor Portal, and the Services accessible in connection with Service Use Entitlements, do not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, malware, spyware, adware or other disruptive software, or any software code which is designed to disrupt, damage, or perform unauthorized or illegal actions on a computer system, or which transmits information or other data from a user's computer without notice to and the express prior consent of the End User.  The Applications You submit through the Vendor Portal, and the Services accessible in connection with Service Use Entitlements, are not designed or usable as a tool for processing e-mail for mass mailing (&quot;spamming&quot; tools or the like). 
                        
                        (5)  With respect to any promotion by You of Your Applications that are made available through the BANGO Commerce Solution or associated Services, You will not display any inaccurate or misleading information concerning Your identity or location, or inaccurate or misleading information concerning the role of BANGO as the seller and merchant of record to the End User for purchases of copies of Your Applications. 
                        
                        (6)  You will not engage in deceptive trade practices, or directly solicit End Users or potential End Users who have not affirmatively consented to receive direct solicitations from You, or otherwise violate any laws, rules or regulations applicable to the sale of copies of Your Application through the BANGO Commerce Solution to End Users on Authorized Networks and the conduct of Your business.
                        
                        (7)  You will not use commercial e-mail (solicited or unsolicited) to market Your Application or associated Service if that use of commercial e-mail violates any applicable laws or regulations regarding the use of commercial e-mail. You will comply with any legal obligations to provide proper labeling and content within Your marketing e-mails, and to provide opt-in or opt-out capabilities to recipients and comply with any such requests. Subject to any approvals required pursuant to Section 3(H) above, any advertising or other marketing materials that mention BANGO, the BlackBerry App World, or the BANGO Commerce Solution, or which contain hyperlinks to the BANGO Commerce Solution or BlackBerry App World, must be in compliance with all laws concerning advertising and marketing for the territories where You deliver those materials. You are responsible for compliance with all of the above, whether You provide the e-mails or advertisements on Your own or use the services of a third party.
                        (8)  You are the owner, licensor and/or distributor of the Applications and associated Services with all rights necessary to allow BANGO to purchase copies of the Applications (or in the case of a Service, a Service Use Entitlement) from You for resale.
                        (9)  The Applications (and Services for which BANGO resells a corresponding Service Use Entitlement) are designed for access, operation, and use on RIM proprietary software operating on wireless handheld devices.
                        
                        C.  By BANGO.  BANGO makes the following additional representations, warranties and covenants to You:
                        
                        (1)  Except to the extent that this prohibition is precluded by law, BANGO shall not modify any Application without Your express written permission, and may not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any Application. 
                        
                        6.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; INDEMNITY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
                        
                        A.  Disclaimer of Warranties.  Except as expressly set out herein, BANGO provides BANGO's valued added reseller services to You on an &quot;AS-IS, AS AVAILABLE&quot; basis and makes no promises as to the percentage up-time of the Vendor Portal, BlackBerry App World or BANGO Commerce Solution, or that the Vendor Portal, BlackBerry App World or BANGO Commerce Solution will operate completely without error.  The Vendor Portal, BlackBerry App World and BANGO Commerce Solution are subject to change without notice.  BANGO HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING THE QUALITY OR AVAILABILITY OF THE VENDOR PORTAL, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD OR BANGO COMMERCE SOLUTION AND ANY OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY BANGO PURSUANT OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, BANGO DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM OR REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY OR CONTENT OF THE BANGO COMMERCE SOLUTION, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD, VENDOR PORTAL, AND/OR BANGO ADMINISTRATIVE INTERFACE OR ANY INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE THEREON, OR ANY ECONOMIC BENEFIT YOU MAY GAIN FROM YOUR USE OF, OR INCLUSION OF YOUR APPLICATIONS ON, THE SAME.    BANGO DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT THE VENDOR PORTAL, BANGO COMMERCE SOLUTION, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD AND ADMINISTRATIVE INTEFACE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR MALICIOUS CONTENT DESPITE ANY EFFORTS BY BANGO AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PREVENT THE INCLUSION OF SUCH CONTENT, AND YOU ACCEPT ALL RISK AND LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE VENDOR PORTAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INTERFACE.  NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS A GUARANTEE, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE LEVEL OF SALES OF COPIES OF YOUR APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CAN EXPECT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
                        
                        BANGO FURTHER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE ACTS AND OMISSIONS OF ANY AND ALL THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROVISION OF THE VENDOR PORTAL, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD OR BANGO COMMERCE SOLUTION OR THE PURCHASE OF COPIES OF  YOUR APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE PROVISION OF THE VENDOR PORTAL AND BLACKBERRY APP WORLD  AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO BANGO BY RIM, AND THE USE, SALE OR REDISTRIBUTION OF AN APPLICATION  BY AN END USER (WHETHER OR NOT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE EULA).
                        
                        EXCEPT FOR ANY OBLIGATIONS BANGO HAS UNDER SECTION 5(C)(1) OR ITS OBLIGATIONS TO PAY YOU THE DUE AMOUNTS (SUBJECT TO THE HOLD BACK PROVISIONS OF SECTION 4(E)(1) YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY BANGO, OR FOR YOUR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE VENDOR PORTAL, BLACKBERRY APP WORLD OR BANGO COMMERCE SOLUTION OR THE SALE OF COPIES OF YOUR APPLICATIONS PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, IS FOR YOU TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT.
                        
                        B.  Indemnity.  You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless BANGO and its Service Providers, their successors and assigns, and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, from and against any and all demands, judgments, losses, costs, expenses, obligations, liabilities, damages, fines, recoveries and deficiencies, including without limitation interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs (collectively, &quot;Losses&quot;) in connection with a claim, action, suit or proceeding made, brought or commenced by a third party other than an affiliate of the indemnified Party (each, a &quot;Claim&quot;), that any such party may incur or suffer, which arise, result from, or relate to:  (i) Your breach of any of Your obligations, representations, warranties or covenants made by You hereunder, (ii) the actual or alleged infringement by Your Applications or copies thereof, or other materials provided by You of any third party proprietary or intellectual property rights, or (iii) any liability arising from an End User's use of Your Applications or any Service in connection with which BANGO resells a Service Use Entitlement.  The indemnified party will promptly notify You in writing of any Claim and will provide You all disclosable information in its possession (at the indemnified party's expense) and reasonable assistance (at Your sole expense) as reasonably necessary to evaluate and defend such Claim, and the authority to settle and/or defend such Claim only in accordance with the following sentence.  You shall obtain each indemnified party's express prior written approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to settle any Claim if such settlement (a) arises from or is part of any criminal action, suit or proceeding, or (b) contains a stipulation to or admission or acknowledgment of any liability or wrongdoing on the part of that indemnified party, or (c) requires any specific performance or non pecuniary remedy by that indemnified party, or (d) requires the actual payment of any amount by that indemnified party.  This indemnity shall survive termination of this Agreement.

                        A.  Term.  This Agreement starts on the date BANGO acknowledges its acceptance of this Agreement as set forth herein, and will last until either You or BANGO terminates this Agreement as set forth herein.  You may terminate this Agreement with or without cause by providing BANGO with no less than thirty (30) calendar days prior notice in writing of Your decision to terminate.   In the event You are in material breach of this Agreement or have failed to perform any of Your material obligations under this Agreement, and have not cured such breach or failure within fourteen (14) calendar days of being notified by BANGO of such breach or failure, BANGO may terminate this Agreement on notice to You without further opportunity to cure.  Further, BANGO may, at any time, terminate this Agreement by delivering to You notice of its decision to do so, if: (a) BANGO ceases to operate the BANGO Commerce Solution in connection with the Blackberry App World; (b) BANGO is required to do so by law; (c) You, or if You have licensed the distribution rights for the Applications, the licensor(s) for those Applications, has entered into a software development agreement: (i) with RIM that is no longer in good standing, that provides for the use of at least one of RIM&rsquo;s development tools listed at http://us.blackberry.com/developers/sdks.jsp and (ii) if applicable, in the case of themes, with Plazmic Inc. (Plazmic) that is no longer in good standing that provides for the use of Plazmic&rsquo;s Content Developer&rsquo;s Kit (CDK); or (d) You are not in good standing with BANGO or RIM (other than due to a breach of this Agreement in which case the cure period set forth above shall apply).
                        
                        B.  Termination.  Upon termination of this Agreement:  (a) You will immediately cease any use of BANGO's name, logos or Trademarks, and remove any approved hyperlinks to the BANGO Commerce Solution that deal with the sale of copies of Your Application; (b) BANGO will promptly halt any sale of copies of Your Application(s) through the BANGO Commerce Solution; (c) BANGO will continue to make payments to You of amounts due to You under this Agreement, on the regular pay cycle dates, until the time that Your account has reached a zero balance (BANGO's hold back rights as described in Section 4(E)(1) above, and Your obligation to pay BANGO for any shortfall in Your account, shall survive the termination of the Agreement); (d) You will continue to provide access to Services in accordance with purchased Service Use Entitlements for the remainder of the subscription period(s) of such Service Use Entitlements; and (e) You will continue to be responsible for any liability that might arise out of Chargebacks, any infringement of intellectual property rights, any violation of laws, rules or regulations that may have occurred as a result of copies of Your Applications or access to Services being made available via the BANGO Commerce Solution, and any breach by You of the terms of this Agreement.
                        
                        C.  Survival.  The provisions of this Agreement which, by their terms, require performance after the termination of this Agreement, or have application to events that may occur after the termination of this Agreement, shall survive the termination of this Agreement, which provisions shall include without limitation sections 1, 2, 3(A), 3(D), 3(E), 3(F), 3(G), 4, 5, 6, 7(B), 7(C), and 8.
                        
                        8.	MISCELLANEOUS
                        
                        A.  Entire Agreement; Assignment.  This Agreement and the BlackBerry App World Guidelines sets forth the entire understanding between You and BANGO with respect to its subject matter, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous proposals, communications, agreements, understandings, negotiations, and representations, whether written or oral, related thereto.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.  However, You may not assign this Agreement, or any of Your rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise) without BANGO's express prior written permission to do so, and any attempt to assign in violation of the preceding shall be null and void. 
                        
                        B.  Changes to this Agreement.  As this agreement has no specified term, and business circumstances and legal requirements may change from time to time, BANGO reserves the right to revise the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any such revisions that are material in nature, BANGO will provide You with notice of such revised version in accordance with section 8. F., otherwise BANGO may provide notice by posting the revised version of the Agreement on the Vendor Portal.  Any revisions to the Agreement which are required in order to comply with legal requirements, or changes in legal requirements, will immediately become effective as of the date BANGO provides notice to You.  All other revisions to the Agreement will become effective thirty (30) calendar days after BANGO provides notice to You of such revisions.  Except as set forth above, no conditions other than those set forth in this Agreement, or amendments or modifications to this Agreement, shall be binding on BANGO unless BANGO expressly agrees to such amendments or modifications in a writing signed by an authorized representative of BANGO.
                        
                        C.  Relationship of the Parties. You and BANGO are independent contractors of, and not an employee, agent or authorized representative of, the other. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee relationship, or other business combination between You and BANGO is intended or created by this Agreement.  Neither party shall have the right, power or authority to act or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of each other.  Without limiting the foregoing, neither party shall make any representations or warranties to third parties on behalf of the other party.  RIM and its affiliates shall be considered third party beneficiaries of sections 3(A), 3(C), 3(D), and 6 of this Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce these sections with respect to RIM and its affiliates only. There are no other third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement.
                        
                        D.  Governing Law; Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without respect to or application of its conflicts-of-laws provisions.   The parties specifically disclaim application of:  (i) the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods; and (ii) of Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code as codified.  If there are any disputes or conflicts related to or arising out of this Agreement, You and BANGO shall use reasonable means to resolve the conflict prior to starting any lawsuits or other litigation, including negotiation between management personnel capable of resolving the conflicts. However, in the event either You or BANGO should start any litigation arising out of this Agreement, You expressly agree that the litigation will take place exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New York City, United States of America, and You expressly agree that any such court has personal jurisdiction over You. You waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens.  Process may be served on either party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.
                        
                        E.  Waiver; Severability.  No waiver of any provision or breach of this Agreement (a) shall be effective unless made in writing, or (b) shall operate as or be construed to be a continuing waiver of such provision or breach.  Any failure by BANGO to enforce any of its rights under this Agreement or any applicable laws shall not constitute a waiver of such right.  The invalidity of non-enforceability of any provision of this Agreement, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall not affect the other provisions hereof, and in any such occasion this Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or non-enforceable provisions were omitted, and the invalid or non-enforceable provision of this Agreement shall automatically be construed as replaced with a valid and enforceable provision which most closely meets or approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid or non-enforceable provision.
                        
                        F.  Notices.  If You are obligated under this Agreement to tell BANGO something or You wish to give BANGO legal notice of any kind, You must do so in writing and deliver it by certified mail, postage pre-paid and return receipt requested or by nationally recognized overnight courier which provides a written proof of delivery, to the following address: Bango.net Ltd, 330 Madison, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10017, USA. .  If BANGO is obligated under this Agreement to tell You something or BANGO wishes to give You legal notice of any kind, BANGO may do so by use of any of the addresses You provide through the Vendor Portal, including postal mail or e-mail, and such notice shall be deemed to be sufficiently delivered to You. If any such notice fails to reach You because You gave BANGO inaccurate address information, BANGO's notice shall nonetheless be deemed to have been validly delivered to You on the date such notice was sent by BANGO.
