			<p>Tell your friends about Apps you find on TATA DoCoMo My Apps by selecting the Facebook Share icon when viewing an App. You provide your own message about the App that gets posted to your Wall and the News Feed of your Facebook friends. You are always in control of what gets posted. TATA DoCoMo My Apps will never post something to Facebook without your approval.</p>
			<p>Unlike sharing from websites, to make sharing on Facebook possible on the mobile phone requires you to authorize the TATA DoCoMo My Apps and give it Facebook permissions. That's only two steps to get Sharing on Facebook turned on.</p>
			<p>When you first attempt to share something, the TATA DoCoMo My Apps will guide you through the steps. You will only need to do this once.</p>
			<p>Try sharing on Facebook right now by selecting an App and clicking on the icon below.</p>
